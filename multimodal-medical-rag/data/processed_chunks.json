E\u2011mail: drchetanjain162@gmail.com INTRODUCTION Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common malignant tumor of human beings. This occurs in the sun\u2011exposed areas of the skin leading to its damage. BCC is a slow\u2011growing tumor with very few cases of metastasis. Rarely, it could be destructive locally, if diagnosis and treatment are delayed. Clinically, morphology of lesion varies from pink colored to pearly papules with ulceration or telangiectatic vessels. The most common site of BCC is the head and neck region but can also involve trunk and extremities.[1,2] Figure 1 show BCC present on trunk. In the literature, more than 26 types of BCC are described but common clinicopathological subtypes are nodular, ulcerative, superficial, morpheaform, infiltrative, and fibroepithelial. Morphologically, single or multiple subtypes could be present in a single case. Lesions could vary from highly pigmented (dark in color) to slightly dark in color. BCC is currently treated through electrodesiccation and curettage, cryosurgery, and Mohs micrographic surgery. MATERIAL AND METHODS The present study was conducted on 42 BCC cases, consisting of \u2011 patients attending the Dermatology OPD, suspected cases were submitted for histopathological examination in the Department of Pathology, Medical College, Kolkata. Histopathological diagnosis was established on routine hematoxylin and eosin staining of the section, the study period was between January 2013 to June 2014. This study aimed to identify the spectrum of histology of BCC along with clinicopathological correlation.

The oldest patient in this study was a 78\u2011year\u2011old male. One patient had xeroderma pigmentosum and he was the second youngest case in the study (31 years). The mean and median age of patients in this study was 54.23 \u00b1 11.74 years and 52.5 years, respectively. Out of the 42 cases, 29 cases had nodular BCC and only 1 case each of basosquamous and sclerosing BCC. Hence, the most common type of histology encountered was nodular type whereas sclerosing and basosquamous were the least common. Figures 2 and 3 illustrate the clinical appearance of Nodular BCC and Figure 4 depicts its histological picture. After nodular, the most common histology of BCC was adenoid (five cases) followed by two cases of superficial BCC. Figure 5 shows adenoid BCC in which tumor cells show glandular differentiation. The most common site was the face (21 cases, 50%), followed by the scalp (17 cases, 40.48%). If we combine cases of scalp and face regions to make it under a single category under the head region, then the total number of cases amounts to 38 (90.47%). Therefore, the most common site was the head region. Only one case (2.38%) was reported to be from the upper limb and three (7.14%) cases from the trunk. The study showed a correlation between the presence and absence of sunlight exposure in BCC cases. Patients working outdoors had plentiful exposure to sunlight. Cases working indoors had comparatively less amount of exposure to sunlight. Out of 42 cases, 23 (54.77%) had a history of direct sunlight exposure for a long duration and 19 (45.23%) cases were found, spending most of their time indoors. Table 1 demonstrates that out of 42 BCC cases 18 (42.85%) had a history of exposure to arsenic and 24 (57.15%) cases did not have exposure history. A single case of morphea had a history of arsenic exposure. Twelve out of 29 cases of nodular BCC had an exposure history. Arsenic exposure through contaminated water is quite prevalent in eastern India, therefore, determining its history is very important. Arsenic plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of BCC. In one case of basal cell hyperplasia, the expression of CD 10 was reported as negative while the expression of CD 10 was present in superficial BCC. Figure 6 shows clinical and Figure 7 show histology of superficial BCC. Similarly, baso-squamous BCC as shown in figure 8 could be a diagnostic challenge considering basoloid squmous cell carcinoma as differential. DISCUSSION BCC is a cancer of hair\u2011bearing skin areas, especially in the head and neck region. In some pockets of eastern India and Bangladesh region, the amount of arsenic present in water exceeds the safe level.[3] Chronic arsenic exposure is considered a risk factor of BCC. Thus, amount of BCC cases in this arsenic belt will be more as compared to other areas of the Indian subcontinent. Therefore, we took proper history for the presence of the excessive amount of arsenic in water at these places.

Cheng et al.[4] also reported thatthe BCC risk increases by 3\u20114 times when drinking water is contaminated by arsenic. Therefore, we should always take a proper history of arsenic contamination in water. Clearly, more outdoor work means more exposure to UV radiations and more chances of BCC[5] In the present study, patients working outdoors were considered as subjects for chronic UV exposure, for example, farmers, building workers, fishermen, or roadside hawkers, etc., In our study, 23 (54.77%) cases out of 42 worked outdoors. The differential diagnosis for superficial BCC is basal cell hyperplasia and basosquamous BCC for squamous cell carcinoma, for which CD 10 could be used for differentiation. It was noted that the expression is present in superficial BCC and absent in basal cell hyperplasia. CD 10 expression could also be used to differentiate between trichoepithelioma and BCC. In BCC, focal positivity was seen in tumor cells whereas stromal positivity was present in trichoepithelioma.[6] Similarly, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) could be confused with basosquamous BCC. In basosquamous BCC dual population of cells are present, cells with scanty cytoplasm and cells with a relatively moderate amount of cytoplasm but in SCC cells with a similar (moderate) amount of cytoplasm are present.

Here are some key clinical features and their relevance:\n\n1. **Color**: The lesion appears to be a dark brown hue, potentially suggesting an increase in melanin production. It's important to monitor changes in color, as irregular pigmentation can be a sign of malignancy.\n\n2. **Shape and Borders**: The mole seems to have relatively well-defined edges. In dermatology, moles with jagged or irregular borders warrant closer examination due to their association with skin cancer.\n\n3. **Size**: While the specific size isn't measurable in this image, a general guideline in dermatology is that any mole larger than 6 mm should be evaluated. \n\n4. **Surface Texture**: The surface appears smooth, which is typical of benign moles. Any changes in texture (e.g., scabbing, flaking) could indicate a need for further",

Irregularity or asymmetry in shape can indicate potential malignancy.\n\n2. **Color Variation**: Note the color distribution within the lesion. Multiple colors (such as red, brown, or black) may suggest different types of pigmentation or vascularization.\n\n3. **Surface Characteristics**: Assess the texture of the surface.

SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING Once the base training data has been acquired, the computer will separate the lesion area from the new input image by mapping the lesion, pixel by pixel, in line with the labels recorded by the dermatologists. During this process, the computer will ascertain whether, according to probability, the part of the image in question is skin or lesion, and if lesion, what can be implied from its position relative to the other lesion pixels \u2013 inferring a relationship between the elements of the image of the lesion and determining the probability of its conformance to the criteria for lesion (rather than skin). The machine learning approach that the project is taking is \u2018supervised\u2019, ie. it has a gold standard training set, thereby maximising the quality of the computer\u2019s algorithmic determinations. Supervised machine learning methods are also used to identify lesions having speci\ufb01 c texture characteristics such as PNs and streaks, through identi\ufb01 cation of relevant features associated with these textures. The project hardware platform comprises a variety of PC processors, Apple and other smartphones, hand- held dermoscopy devices and cameras. So far, the project has found that images of lesions taken in uncorrected mode provide better inputs for machine learning, and that other picture formats require additional support: \u201cWe are continuing to develop new correction methods based on basic camera parameters observed from imaging standard colour charts,\u201d af\ufb01 rms Atkins.

Practical considerations arising from the different perspectives require balance and compromises to be achieved, as Atkins sums up: \u201cWe computer scientists want super high-quality skin images obtained using oil on the skin to prevent white scale from appearing in the images. However, the dermatologists point out that in a clinical setting, using oil is very messy; it takes much longer to deal with each patient\u201d. Adjustments that have been made to accommodate such requirements include adapting the computer algorithms to take white scale in images into account and using gel or alcohol as a means to obtaining better de\ufb01 ned images of lesions.
