Despite notable progress in skin cancer prevention and diagnosis, the limitations of existing methods accentuate the demand for precise diag­ nostic tools. Biosensors have emerged as valuable clinical tools, enabling rapid and reliable point-of-care (POC) testing of skin cancer. This review offers insights into skin cancer development, highlights essential cutaneous melanoma biomarkers, and assesses the current landscape of biosensing technologies for diagnosis. The comprehensive analysis in this review underscores the transformative potential of biosensors in revolutionizing melanoma skin cancer diagnosis, emphasizing their critical role in advancing patient outcomes and healthcare efficiency. The increasing availability of these approaches supports direct diagnosis and aims to reduce the reliance on biopsies, enhancing POC diagnosis. Recent advancements in biosensors for skin cancer diagnosis hold great promise, with their integration into healthcare expected to enhance early detection accuracy and reli­ ability, thereby mitigating socioeconomic disparities. 1. Introduction Skin cancer, a globally prevalent malignancy, has seen a significant increase in incidence since the late 20th century. In 2020, over 1.5 million skin cancer cases were diagnosed, with projections indicating a rise to over 2.3 million by 2040. Ultraviolet (UV) radiation, driven by stratospheric ozone changes and climate shifts, stands as the primary cause of most skin cancer cases (D’Orazio et al., 2013). Non-melanoma skin cancers, predominantly Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) and Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC), are relatively less aggressive. However, cuta­ neous melanoma, though less common, is highly dangerous, accounting for 80% of skin cancer deaths and posing a substantial metastatic risk (Davis et al., 2019). Scientific advancements, such as the introduction of dermoscopy and computer-assisted diagnostic tools, have improved our understanding of skin tumours. These developments span from the 1980s, when early melanoma detection efforts began, to the creation of devices like the MoleMax (DermaMedical Systems, Vienna, Austria) and MelaFind (Electro-Optical Sciences, Irvington, NY) in the 1990s (Fig. 1) (Gutkowicz-Krusin et al., 2000; Young et al., 2021). Multispectral technology and algorithmic integration came in the 2000s, with real-time imaging techniques like ultrasound, confocal microscopy, and bioimpedance contributing since 2005 (Aberg et al., 2004; Carrara et al., 2007; Rigel et al., 2010). Additionally, tape-stripping techniques and smartphone apps have further advanced melanoma screening (Wong et al., 2006). The last decade has witnessed the combination of previ­ ously invented technologies, producing integrated systems like Vectra WB360 (Canfield Scientific, USA) and MoleSafe (MoleSafe™, USA) (Rayner et al., 2018). Moreover, AI, machine learning, and computer vision have demonstrated promise in enhancing melanoma diagnostics, though access to substantial data pipelines remains a challenge for clinical-grade AI (Atkins et al., 2021;

machine learning, and computer vision have demonstrated promise in enhancing melanoma diagnostics, though access to substantial data pipelines remains a challenge for clinical-grade AI (Atkins et al., 2021; Schlessinger et al., 2019; Tschandl et al., 2019; Waldman et al., 2021; Young et al., 2020). Studies have highlighted convolutional neural networks’ (CNNs) effectiveness in bi­ nary image classification of skin neoplasms, including melanoma and keratinocyte cancers (Han et al., 2018). CNNs consistently match or surpass expert clinicians in performance yet their transition to real-world clinical settings is ongoing (Atkins et al., 2021).

Biosensors and Bioelectronics 250 (2024) 116045 3 decision-support tools is pivotal, but biopsies often remain necessary for definitive diagnoses (Freeman et al., 2020). Biopsies, while effective, carry drawbacks like cost, discomfort, and potential complications, The gold standard of skin biopsy is associated with excessive cost, painful patient discomfort, labour intensity, restricted suitability, infection risk near the perforated location, and wound dehiscence, necessitating the development of accurate, quantifiable and non-invasive diagnostic tools (Linares et al., 2015). Biosensing technologies, when integrated with existing diagnostic tools, offer the potential for efficient, low-cost, and highly specific POC tests for early skin cancer detection. The global POC diagnostic bio­ sensors market is projected to reach $25 billion by 2030, with biosensors advancing significantly due to nanotechnology (Strategic Market Search, 2022). These biosensing techniques reduce the need for biopsies, enhance precision, and allow for early diagnosis, even as wearable de­ vices. Examples include microneedle bandage sensors and hydrogel-coated microneedle patches for biomarker sampling (Al Sulaiman et al., 2019; Ciui et al., 2018). This article serves as a comprehensive resource for researchers and clinicians in the field, exploring the latest advances in skin cancer bio­ sensing technologies and diagnostic biomarkers. It aims to identify knowledge gaps and foster the development of more precise, efficient, and cost-effective diagnostic tools. It uniquely bridges the gap between traditional diagnostic methods and cutting-edge biosensing applica­ tions, highlighting the urgent need for seamless integration of these technologies into clinical practice. By identifying knowledge gaps and fostering the development of more precise, efficient, and cost-effective diagnostic tools, this review not only informs but also catalyzes inno­ vation in the field. The review covers benchtop and portable biosensing technologies, including the detection of malignant melanoma signalling proteins and nucleic acids, making it a valuable resource for those seeking the most recent developments in melanoma skin cancer diagnosis. 2. Skin cancer 2.1. Development of cutaneous melanoma Cutaneous melanoma results from mutations in pigment-producing cells present in the base of the epidermis which results in uncontrolled cellular proliferation and malignant tumour formation. Due to its pro­ pensity to rapidly metastasize to other organs when not promptly addressed, it represents the most severe and life-threatening manifes­ tation of skin cancer (Saginala et al., 2021). The four major histological subtypes of cutaneous melanoma are “superficial spreading, nodular, lentigo maligna, and acral lentiginous melanoma” (D’Orazio et al., 2013), corresponding to 70%, 5%, 4 − 15%, 2–5% respectively of the reported cases (Linares et al., 2015). The most commonly used system to stage melanoma has been introduced by the “American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)” and focuses on the tumour, nodes, and metastasis basis outlining five stages (Fig. 2) (Borsari and Longo, 2017). In stages 0-II diagnostic biomarkers are used to confirm the presence and type of the disease, while after a confirmed diagnosis in more progressed stages (II-IV), prognostic biomarkers provide information on the patient’s likely outcome. Prognostic biomarkers are evaluated before treatment and help to identify tumour-specific molecular or histopathological characteristics. The overall formation of the diagnosis is dependent on the following clinically relevant factors: thickness, ulceration, mitotic rate, serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes, vertical growth phase, and regression, thus evaluating the level of aggressiveness, the possibility of metastasis or effective immune response. 2.2. Epidemiological statistics The prevalence of skin cancer has increased significantly

and regression, thus evaluating the level of aggressiveness, the possibility of metastasis or effective immune response. 2.2. Epidemiological statistics The prevalence of skin cancer has increased significantly since the end of the 20th century. Data published by the WHO state that inter­ nationally in 2020 more than 1.5 million skin cancer cases were reported and more than 120,000 deaths were attributed to skin cancer (Fig. 3) Fig. 2. Schematic illustration of skin cancer progression in different skin layers. Stages 0-I of melanoma are limited to the epidermis, with stage II being thicker and extending into the dermis. Stage III indicates evolution further into the dermis while spreading to nearby lymph nodes and stage IV is metastasis to other parts of the body. E. Chatzilakou et al.

Biosensors and Bioelectronics 250 (2024) 116045 4 (World Health Organization, 2020). In 2040, the mortality is estimated to increase by 65%, and the total number of skin cancer cases to surpass 2.3 million worldwide. Although the overall 5-year survival of mela­ noma has risen to 90.5% in the US, survival for disease stages III and IV remains only 60.3 and 16.2%, respectively, with an estimated 48% in­ crease in global mortality by 2040 (National Cancer Institute, 2022; World Health Organization, 2020). Caucasians face elevated risk due to limited melanin protection against sun exposure (Narayanamurthy et al., 2018). In the US, mela­ noma incidence varies by race/ethnicity. Non-Hispanic Whites have the highest rate at 26 per 100,000, compared to lower rates in Native Americans/Alaskan Natives (7.4), Hispanics (4.6), Asians (1.3), and non-Hispanic Blacks (1.0) (American Cancer Society, 2023; Harvey et al., 2014). However, Black and Native American patients often pre­ sent melanoma at later stages, and Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders show adverse indicators at diagnosis, including lymph node involve­ ment (Fahmy et al., 2023). These disparities intensified from 2000 to 2010 and beyond, despite screening protocol improvements and immunotherapy advances. Socioeconomic and genetic factors, along with differences in tumour proliferation (high ki-67 expression), cell cycle regulation (low-level p53 staining), and angiogenesis, contribute to variations in disease manifestation and prognosis (Shao and Feng, 2022). 3. Biosensors for diagnostics 3.1. Foundations and principles of biosensing Melanoma misdiagnosis is responsible for more malpractice and misdiagnosis claims than any other malignancy, second only to breast cancer, while early misdiagnosis drastically reduces a patient’s likeli­ hood of survival (Eftekhari et al., 2019). The importance of developing precise, quantitative, early and decisive skin cancer diagnostic tools is highlighted by the inadequacy of the current means to considerably reduce the mortality rate of skin cancer and enhance early verified diagnosis (McQuade et al., 2018). In pursuit of this, the currently available indicative tools could be integrated with biosensing technol­ ogies for locating problematic areas and identifying biomarkers with suitable innovative bioreceptors, holding the potential to be used as point-of-care (POC), effective, highly specific, and affordable diagnostic modalities. Biosensors for skin cancer detection are composed of a recognition element in very close spatial proximity with a physical transduction element. Thus, as analytical devices for skin cancer diagnostics, bio­ sensors consist of three fundamental components: (i) the detector, responsible for sensing the stimulus or the biological component specific to skin cancer (biorecognition); (ii) the transducer, which transforms the skin cancer-related stimulus in an output signal (signalization); and (iii) the signal processing system that quantifies the output signal (Nagel et al., 1992) (Fig. 4). Bioreceptors, which are mainly immobilized biological systems, are Fig. 3.

Biosensors and Bioelectronics 250 (2024) 116045 5 bonded to the surface of the transducer and are responsible for the identification and specific capturing of the analyte, as well as the physical-chemical mechanism that will generate the signal. Bioreceptors determine the level of specificity of the biosensors and are classified into four major categories “antibodies, enzymes, nucleic acids, and cellular structures” (Naresh and Lee, 2021). Further bioreceptors, such as aptamers, ribonucleic acids, peptides, and macrophages, are progres­ sively being integrated into the context of skin cancer detection. Antibodies are widely used in biosensors for their high specificity and affinity in antibody-antigen interactions, particularly relevant in identifying skin cancer biomarkers, but face challenges in long-term stability and manufacturing costs, particularly in multi-target applica­ tions (Rasooly and Herold, 2009). Enzymatic biosensors offer advan­ tages like high sensitivity and direct visualization, which is crucial in the early detection of skin cancer, though their use as bioreceptors can be complicated by interference from endogenous enzymes (Bucur et al., 2021; Velusamy et al., 2010). Nucleic acid biosensors use strands as bioreceptors for target analytes through complementary base pairing, offering stability and selectivity with rapid, reversible responses, mak­ ing them suitable for detecting genetic mutations associated with skin cancer, but face challenges of irreversible DNA damage affecting repli­ cation and signal amplification (Liu et al., 2019; Perumal and Hashim, 2014; Vo-Dinh and Cullum, 2000). Cell-based biosensors, utilizing live cells as bioreceptors, offer benefits such as non-invasive monitoring and rapid response, valuable for ongoing monitoring of skin cancer pro­ gression, yet their effectiveness is limited by factors affecting cell viability, including cell lifespan and sterilization methods (Ziegler, 2000). The four major categories of biosensors according to the transduction techniques they employ are mass, electrochemical, magnetic, and opti­ cal, each with potential applications in skin cancer detection (Bhalla et al., 2016). These techniques are further classified and referred to as direct recognition methods when biosensors take direct advantage of the phenomenon occurring on the transducer surface (i.e., label-free) or indirect when the detection is enhanced by secondary elements, such as fluorophores (Heineman and Jensen, 2006). Recently, scientists have incorporated nanomaterials and nanoparticles in the transduction process to further improve biosensing properties such as sensitivity, response time, and reproducibility in skin cancer diagnostics (Malekzad et al., 2017). Mass transducers in biosensors use vibrating piezoelectric crystals to detect mass changes on their surface, offering real-time, label-free detection but facing issues with specificity and interference which can be critical in the accurate detection of skin cancer markers. Electro­ chemical biosensors, categorized into amperometric, potentiometric, or impedimetric based on the measured parameter, are known for their sensitivity and cost-effectiveness but suffer from signal drift in long-term use especially when used for continuous monitoring of skin cancer biomarkers (Bakker and Telting-Diaz, 2002; Kim et al., 2019). Optical-based biosensors, utilizing various techniques like fluorescence, chemiluminescence, and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), are widely used for their high sensitivity and specificity, though they face challenges such as photobleaching in fluorescence and the need for excellent bioreceptor immobilization in colourimetry which are signif­ icant considerations in the development of optical biosensors for skin cancer (Perez-Jimenez et al., 2020; Qi and Zhang, 2020; Tainaka et al., 2010; Yetisen et al., 2019). 3.2.

Biosensor design and safety for skin cancer Biosensors for skin cancer diagnostics represent a promising area, demanding careful design strategies to ensure adaptability, precision, and compatibility with the skin’s unique environment (Rodrigues et al., 2020). Crucial factors such as pH, temperature, and salinity vary significantly across different skin layers and biological fluids, affecting biomolecule behaviour and sensor performance (Zucolotto, 2020). This necessitates the use of non-invasive or minimally invasive sampling methods like interstitial fluid (ISF) sampling to minimize biological system perturbations. Point-of-care (POC) systems are particularly ad­ vantageous in skin cancer diagnostics due to their ability for miniatur­ ization and integration of automated sample pre-treatment, enhancing robustness against unsolicited components in biological fluids (Lich­ tenberg et al., 2019) (Fig. 4). The development of these biosensors involves optimizing Fig. 4.

Biosensors and Bioelectronics 250 (2024) 116045 6 bioreceptor selectivity to reduce non-specific interactions and enhance binding efficiency with relevant biomarkers (Lichtenberg et al., 2019). Biofouling, resulting from unspecific biomolecule adsorption and the formation of biofluid and microorganism layers, poses a significant challenge, potentially impairing sensor reliability (Liu, 2021). Innova­ tive solutions such as perm-selective protective polymeric coatings are being explored to mitigate these effects by excluding macromolecules and controlling device exposure (Wisniewski and Reichert, 2000). Moreover, the choice of transducer is pivotal for achieving high sensitivity and selectivity in detecting a range of analytes relevant to skin cancer, such as nucleic acids, metabolites, and proteins. Electro­ chemical transducers are increasingly favoured in this context (Bakker and Telting-Diaz, 2002). For effective real-time monitoring and diag­ nosis, advanced reporting methods like smartphone integration and portable spectrometers are being utilized, offering accurate, quantita­ tive measurements in a cost-effective and user-friendly format (Zhang et al., 2022b). Skin-integrated wearable and implantable biosensor devices, designed to be flexible, lightweight, and ultra-thin, are crucial for comfortable skin movement accommodation and adaptation to the 3D shape of organs (Gray et al., 2018). The substrate materials for bio­ sensors, such as polymers, carbon-based materials, and metal oxides, are chosen for their flexibility, biocompatibility, and large surface area, ensuring minimal immune response and optimal interaction with the biological system (Abu Owida, 2022). Such design considerations ensure that biosensors for skin cancer diagnosis not only meet the clinical re­ quirements but also align with patient comfort and usability. The direct interface of biosensing technologies with the human body necessitates a rigorous and thorough evaluation of their safety profile. Essential to this evaluation is the identification and mitigation of po­ tential risks, including skin irritation, allergic reactions, and unforeseen long-term effects. It is imperative that these biosensors undergo comprehensive safety assessments, which should encompass dermato­ logical testing for biocompatibility and hypersensitivity reactions. This testing regime must adhere to stringent regulatory standards and ethical guidelines to ensure patient welfare. Furthermore, the materials and chemicals used in biosensor con­ struction demand careful selection to minimize adverse reactions. Biocompatible and hypoallergenic substances should be prioritized to reduce the likelihood of immunological responses or skin irritation. Continuous monitoring during clinical application is also crucial for early detection and management of any adverse effects. This vigilance allows for the immediate adaptation of the biosensing technology, ensuring ongoing patient safety and comfort. 4. Skin cancer biomarkers The deployment of biosensors for skin cancer diagnosis requires ac­ cess to fluids proper for detecting biomarkers. Given their abundance, diagnostic capabilities, and simple sample extraction, readily available bodily fluids, including saliva, sweat, blood, and urine, have been employed for non- or minimally-invasive sampling. Throughout the pursuit of the most effective biomolecules for disease onset and pro­ gression, serologic biomarkers have gained attention in melanoma research (Belter et al., 2017). Nevertheless, skin melanoma biomarkers are predominantly present within the melanocytes, in the extracellular fluid surrounding them, or in ISF (Madden et al., 2020; Senf et al., 2020). The abundance of ISF volumetrically in the epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous tissue is approximately 15–35%, 40%, and 20% respec­ tively (Groenendaal et al., 2010). Interstitial fluid contains almost all analytes present in the blood, including RNA species and circulating

approximately 15–35%, 40%, and 20% respec­ tively (Groenendaal et al., 2010). Interstitial fluid contains almost all analytes present in the blood, including RNA species and circulating proteins, with over 90% of proteins shared between blood and ISF (Friedel et al., 2023). Furthermore, skin ISF contains approximately 83% of the proteins present in serum, but approximately 50% of proteins present in ISF cannot be found in serum, suggesting that unique and common biomarkers can be detected in ISF (Samant and Prausnitz, 2018). ISF can be sampled painlessly and with minimal risk of blood contamination and requires no prior treatment for biomarker analysis. Biomarkers for skin cancer fall into three categories: diagnostic markers for initial screening, prognostic indicators for monitoring dis­ ease progression after diagnosis, and predictive markers that can fore­ cast treatment outcomes (Weinstein et al., 2014). However, this classification lacks clarity as the profiles and applicability of these bio­ markers have not been comprehensively analysed yet. Premelanosome protein (PMEL) (else gp100), Melan-A (else MART-1), tyrosinase, MITF, and s100, as well as several recently reported biomarkers, are among those being considered for melanoma diagnosis (Table 1) (Weinstein et al., 2014). Apart from conventionally deployed immunohistochemical assays, recently developed detection methods of diagnostic and prog­ nostic biomarkers utilize novel techniques based on biosensing princi­ ples, such as the in situ fluorescent hybridization of ribonucleic acids, the detection of enzymatic activities and antigen-antibody interactions. Nevertheless, a combination of biomarkers may be required to distin­ guish melanoma from melanocytic nevi, as melanoma may acquire several different mutations as it progresses toward cancer (Trager et al., 2022). Thus, mutation combinations that upregulate or downregulate specific genes may prove more consistent with a tangible diagnosis. 4.1. Proteins and enzymes 4.1.1. Cell surface proteins Cell surface biomarkers can be useful for biosensing technologies meant for the diagnosis of cutaneous melanoma, since they can offer specific and reliable information about the characteristics of melanoma cells and enable the identification of circulating tumour cells (CTCs). PMEL is a nonmutated antigen expressed in most melanoma and healthy skin cells (Zhang et al., 2021). PMEL has been detected in blood by mass spectrophotometry (The Human Protein Atlas, 2022c) and is over-expressed at all stages of skin cancer, with low expression in tissues other than the skin. Another melanocytic membrane protein is the Мelan-A (else known as MART-1; melanoma antigen recognized by T-cells-1), located in organoids of melanocytes (Weinstein et al., 2014), without yet having been detected in blood or serum (The Human Protein Atlas, 2022a). Also, Melan-A is essential for the expression, stability, trafficking, and processing of the PMEL protein, nonetheless, its pres­ ence in benign nevi, renders it a marker of histogenesis rather than malignancy (Weedon, 2010). Melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) is the receptor of two melanocortin peptides, hence is commonly combined with radiopeptide tumour targeting methods either for diagnostic pur­ poses via single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) imaging or therapy (Matichard et al., 2004). Melanocytes express MC1R highly in the majority (>80%) of both primary and metastatic mela­ noma cell lines (Salazar-Onfray et al., 2002; Seenivasan et al., 2015). However, MC1R has been mainly studied as a prognostic risk factor for melanoma skin cancer, indicating it could be deployed for the detection of high-risk groups and prevention measures (Matichard et al., 2004). 4.1.2.

and tumour-promoting proteins Cell regulative and tumour-promoting factors are valuable for developing diagnostic biosensors and reducing the frequency of false positive diagnoses. They hold the potential to be measured in blood or tissue samples using biosensing techniques, enabling monitoring of disease progression, and targeted therapies. The microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) controls the development and expression of melanocytes and melanogenesis enzyme genes, but extracellular acidification during carcinogenesis re­ sults in its reduced expression (The Human Protein Atlas, 2022b). The factor is present intracellularly and has not been detected in other bio­ logical fluids, thus limiting its detection via immunohistochemical as­ says, without offering tissue specificity. Similarly, the MAGE-I subgroup is being overexpressed in breast, ovary, lung, testis and bladder cancer. They are known to promote tumour cell viability and inhibit cell E. Chatzilakou et al.

The melanoma inhibitory activity protein (MIA) was found to be highly expressed and exocytosed in malignant melanocytes (Riechers and Bosserhoff, 2014) and engage in the metastasis of melanoma skin cancer via augmented cell migration and immunosuppression (Riechers and Bosserhoff, 2014). A clinical study showed that MIA levels in serum were significantly higher in III-IV stage patients than I-II stage patients and healthy donors. Studies revealed that in the cases where MIA serum levels surpassed 914.7 pg/mL diseequation disease was predicted with 86.4% specificity and 95.5% sensitivity (Li et al., 2021), rendering it a prognostic marker for high-risk populations. CEACAM1 is a transmembrane protein associated with the deterio­ ration of metastatic melanoma due to its ability to enhance tumour cell invasiveness presenting significantly increased serum levels upon monitoring active patients (Draberova et al., 2000; Markel et al., 2010). A direct relationship was observed between the levels of CEACAM1 and LDH levels in high-risk metastatic patients, both being independently negatively correlated with survival suggesting that CEACAM1 has a systemic role in melanoma (Markel et al., 2010). Garcia et al. discovered that the inner nuclear membrane protein LAP1 is overexpressed in primary migrating and metastatic melanoma cells making them more adaptable to microenvironment limitations during migration and contributing to tumour belligerence (Jung-Garcia et al., 2023). Furthermore, LAP1 expression in the tumour-invasive front was linked to shorter disease-free survival and poor prognosis. Caveolin-1 (cav-1) is a cell membrane and exosomes protein, involved in various cellular processes thus targeting it can be a thera­ peutic strategy for treating melanoma (Diaz et al., 2020; Friedel et al., 2023). In melanoma cells, the expression of cav-1 is often downregulated, which leads to increased cell proliferation and apoptosis. Cav1 levels in melanoma patients’ blood are significantly higher than in healthy individuals providing potential diagnostic sensitivity based on the detection of cav1-positive (cav-1+) exosomes (68%) instead of other melanoma-related housekeeping proteins like CD63 (43%) (Logozzi et al., 2009). The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been studied for its role in the angiogenesis of malignant melanoma tumours (Redondo et al., 2000). As a mitogen promotes the formation of new blood vessels and increases the permeability of EC monolayers, thus the permeability of macromolecules and nutrients to the main tumour body (May et al., 2005). However, high blood VEGF is associated with renal, liver, endometrial, urothelial and cervical cancer, thus it is not melanoma-specific. 4.1.3. Tyrosinase-related proteins Tyrosinase (TYR) is an ISF-detected enzyme that catalyzes the con­ version of the amino acid tyrosine into dopaquinone which is subse­ quently converted into melanin and potentially induces tumour regression (Ghanem and Fabrice, 2011; Merimsky et al., 1999). The overexpression and hyperaccumulation render it a melanoma biomarker while being directly correlated to the level of malignancy. Monitoring the dynamic change of tyrosinase concentration could be a predictive factor for the progression of the disease (Ren et al., 2022). The RT-PCR (“Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction”) method has been used to detect tyrosinase mRNA and produced very accurate results (Eftekhari et al., 2019). However, studies for tyrosinase mRNA in circulating blood have produced inconsistent results, which could be attributed to the temporary presence of melanoma cells in the bloodstream or the lack of established standards (Eftekhari et al., 2019). The transmembrane glycoprotein TYRP1 is also involved in melanin synthesis as a component and transport factor of melanosomes, regu­ lating TYR

of established standards (Eftekhari et al., 2019). The transmembrane glycoprotein TYRP1 is also involved in melanin synthesis as a component and transport factor of melanosomes, regu­ lating TYR activity, and inhibiting melanocytic cell death (Bolander et al., 2008; Ghanem and Fabrice, 2011). TYRP-1 is overexpressed in the majority of metastatic melanoma tissues and is associated with tumour stage but not with overall or disease-free survival (Bolander et al., 2008; Escors, 2014).

Biosensors and Bioelectronics 250 (2024) 116045 8 4.1.4. S-100 family proteins S-100 family proteins are extracellularly secreted in melanocytes (Jing et al., 2013) but due to their involvement in various physiological cellular processes during histopathology staining they are identified concurrently with other markers (Heizmann, 2019; Weinstein et al., 2014). The binding protein S100B has been detected in blood (The Human Protein Atlas, 2022d) and elevated levels of S100B in the serum of stage III patients are a robust predictor of melanoma-specific survival. Monitoring S100B levels has proven beneficial in assessing the response to immunochemotherapy treatments like dabrafenib and vemurafenib. It is recommended to monitor the serum levels of S100B for a period of 10 years in advanced-stage patients when the levels surpass 0.13 μg/L (Bouwhuis et al., 2011) since levels above 0.6 μg/L can increase the relative death rate by 5-fold (Eftekhari et al., 2019). cDNA analysis of patients with advanced disease states revealed increased S100A8 and S100A9 gene expression in metastases compared to primary melanomas and serum levels greater than 5.5 mg/L were linked to poor overall survival (Wagner et al., 2019). 4.2. Genetic mutations and nucleic acids The BRAF mutation is an oncogenic initiator in melanoma; upregu­ lates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway while detected in 66% of genetic alteration cases in melanoma cells (Rose­ nkranz et al., 2013; Wuethrich et al., 2021). BRAF controls among others processes cell proliferation, migration, and survival (Huber et al., 2013). The constitutive stimulation of BRAF/MAPK signalling maintained by the BRAFV600E kinase mutant is linked to the increase of glycolysis which is the primary energy source for melanoma skin cancer (Ava­ gliano et al., 2020). Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) were identified as post-transcription regulators of gene expression, carcinogenesis, and disease progression. Some miRNAs, like miR-214 and miR-203, are pleiotropic thus dysre­ gulating gene expression and facilitating tumour suppression in many tumours (Gerloff et al., 2020; Neagu et al., 2020). On the contrary, miR-21 and miR-221, which are regulated by the MITF, are specific for melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma (Gerloff et al., 2020; Neagu et al., 2020). miRNAs have been extracted from exosomes that carry specific cell surface markers, but their clinical and diagnostic for mel­ anoma should be further certified (Choi et al., 2022; Eftekhari et al., 2019). 4.3. Other molecular and microenvironmental factors Microenvironmental changes in pre-malignant lesions impact mela­ noma tumour formation (Boussadia et al., 2018; Sahu et al., 2019). The skin’s normal inner layers are slightly alkaline (pH 7.3 ± 0.1) (Guna­ thilake et al., 2009), however, tumour development acidifies the microenvironment due to increased glycolysis and lactate accumulation, resulting in pH decreases as low as 6.4 (Boussadia et al., 2018; Vaupel et al., 1989). The Na+/H+ exchanger, regulated by the prevalent mel­ anoma mutation BRAFV600E, induces pH dysregulation and metastatic spread (Koch and Schwab, 2019). miR-211, a potential target for hypoxia-induced cell death, is frequently lost during melanoma devel­ opment (Dratkiewicz et al., 2021) and activated fibroblasts, a significant portion of the tumour mass (80%), secrete elevated VEGFA under hyp­ oxia, influencing angiogenesis (Dratkiewicz et al., 2021). Lactic acid is consistently found in interstitial fluid (ISF) samples (Samant et al., 2020) and elevated lactate leads to increased serum LDH (Dratkiewicz et al., 2021; Keung and Gershenwald, 2018; Palmer et al., 2011). Notably, serum LDH levels gauge the effectiveness of therapeutic agents like nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and ipilimumab. 5.

Biosensing technologies for skin cancer diagnosis With increasing skin cancer rates and the limitations of biopsies, researchers are striving for biosensing breakthroughs that could be in­ tegrated into portable POC devices, enhancing accessibility, eliminating inter-clinician variability, providing highly accurate results and miti­ gating the consequences of late skin cancer diagnosis. 5.1. Proteins and enzymes towards melanoma detection 5.1.1. Detection of malignant melanoma cells Sensor-based imaging and immunosensing have advanced to detect melanoma cells with high specificity and sensitivity, enhancing mela­ noma diagnosis accuracy, especially in biopsies and surgery when pos­ itive margins indicate the risk of recurrence. A recently developed infrared (IR) sensor examines skin biopsy sections to identify malignant melanoma cells by recording the 3330–3570 nm absorption spectra using a micron-scale light spot and a monochromator while deploying a versatile computational environment for controlled data acquisition, processing, and storage (Fioravanti et al., 2016). The detection principle owes to the fact that cancerous areas demonstrate different spectral forms with significantly higher methy­ lene (H–C–H) stretching ratios compared to normal tissues (Fig. 5a). The presented label-free IR sensor could be a supportive tool during the histopathological assays thus decreasing the risk of misdiagnosis. Due to enhanced deep penetration and decreased nonspecific fluorescence, near infrared-emitting fluorophores (NIR) have demonstrated higher tumour-to-background ratios, rendering NIR-based imaging techniques a powerful solution for cancer diagnosis and resection (Keereweer et al., 2012). Zambito et al. created a cell-based diagnostic sensor that uses dual-optical imaging to detect subcutaneous metastatic melanoma cells. For dual-colour bioluminescence imaging in vivo, tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs), which accumulate in hypoxic areas and infil­ trate melanoma tissues, were engineered to express a green luciferase and an NIR fluorescent dye, while melanoma cells were engineered to express an NIR red luciferase (Fig. 5b) (Zambito et al., 2022). An IVIS spectrum imager captured real-time in vivo images and generated a signal intensity map of the bioluminescent and fluorescent signals. The researchers demonstrated that engineered macrophages at a concen­ tration of 10 million could detect and significantly accumulate in sub­ cutaneous metastatic melanoma in a clinically relevant murine model with subcutaneously engrafted cells. Increased interest exists in developing real-time techniques for improving intraoperative micromelanoma detection, especially with positive margins indicating incomplete tumour cell removal. Day et al. identified the optimal FDA-approved fluorescently labelled antibody for imaging in a preclinical murine ear model mimicking metastatic mela­ noma, laying the groundwork for an intraoperative melanoma recog­ nition sensor (Day et al., 2013). Researchers leveraged NIR fluorescence for studying bevacizumab, panitumumab, and tocilizumab antibodies targeting VEGF, EGFR, and IL-6R. All exhibited superior tumour-to-background ratios over non-specific IgG antibodies, with bevacizumab and panitumumab also aiding residual disease detection and improving tumour resections. Despite their effectiveness in dis­ tinguishing tumours and overexpressed EGFR, VEGF, and IL-6R in Western blot analysis, these antibodies lack melanoma specificity, necessitating further scope development. Recent breakthroughs in identifying and quantifying CTCs and isolating tumour vesicles in patients’ blood have revolutionized the potential of liquid biopsy for cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and manage­ ment, including melanoma. To this end, a novel electrochemical immunosensing strategy has been developed using polyaniline (PANI) nanofibers functionalized with anti-MC1R antibody and a screen- printed electrode

including melanoma. To this end, a novel electrochemical immunosensing strategy has been developed using polyaniline (PANI) nanofibers functionalized with anti-MC1R antibody and a screen- printed electrode (SPE) platform, aiming to detect melanoma cells by targeting the MC1R cell surface protein (Prathap et al., 2018). The PANI nanofibers are chosen for their unique electrical properties, stability, and ability to effectively bind and immobilize biomolecules. The experimental parameters of the immunosensor were optimized to ach­ ieve a limit of quantification of 1 cell/mL and a relatively wide linear E. Chatzilakou et al.

Biosensors and Bioelectronics 250 (2024) 116045 9 range from 15 to 7000 cells/5 mL tested in a suitable solution, given the high surface area of the nanofibers. Targeting melanoma cells was very specific as the sensor did not respond to normal human embryonic kidney cells. Also, a theragnostic hybrid graphene oxide-based assay that can selectively detect G361 melanoma CTCs in blood samples has been developed (Viraka Nellore et al., 2014). Detecting CTCs in blood demands exceptional sensitivity hence the G361-specific AGE-aptamer was utilized, conjugated with indocyanine green (ICG) on magnetic nanoparticles. These were attached to a hybrid graphene oxide platform enabling multi-colour luminescence. The malignant cells that bonded to the aptamer-graphene oxide detection system were separated by the blood sample with a bar magnet at 97% efficiency. The distinction of the malignant melanoma cells present in the blood sample was achieved by detecting the melanoma inhibitor of apoptosis protein (ML-IAP) via ELISA. The ICG-bound magnetic nanoparticles achieved 99% cell death efficiency functioning as combinational photodynamic and photo­ thermal therapeutic agents (Viraka Nellore et al., 2014). The developed theragnostic tool could be very beneficial for POC applications, once properly validated in clinically relevant samples, and concentrations. Seenivasan et al. proposed a portable approach of an electrochemical immunosensor which in the future if coupled with a microfluidic “lab- on-a-chip” platform could detect CTCs in blood samples (Seenivasan et al., 2015). The proposed system is highly selective as it relies on the affinity between the protein MC1R and the anti-MC1R antibody (MC1R-Ab) which was immobilized via amino-functionalized silica nanoparticles (n-SiNPs) on polypyrrole (PPy) nanocomposites (Fig. 6a). To detect the alteration of the produced electrochemical signal the re­ searchers studied the anodic oxidation current, using ferricyanide as the redox mediator. The antigen–antibody interaction decreases the volta­ metric peak by hindering the electron transfer reaction of the redox mediator and the sensor surface. Although an adequate quantification limit of 20 cells/mL and a linear performance was achieved, the per­ formance of the immunosensor integrated with a microfluidic system should be further investigated to function as a clinical diagnostic tool. Thus, Prathap et al. developed and optimized an immuno-electrochemical biosensor integrated into a microfluidic Fig. 5.

Biosensors and Bioelectronics 250 (2024) 116045 10 system to detect MC1R in circulating melanoma cells (Anu Prathap et al., 2019). The same antigen-antibody system (MC1R-anti-MC1R) was employed, nonetheless, this time the anti-MC1R antibody was cova­ lently immobilized to polyaniline nanofibers (PANI)-modified working electrode surface on a screen-printed electrode (SPE), which was incorporated in a PDMS microfluidic channel for cell sample circulation (Fig. 6b). A significantly low limit of quantification (1 cell/mL) was accomplished in a solution containing peripheral blood mononuclear cells, while the signal was log-linear from 1 to 900 melanoma cells/mL (Anu Prathap et al., 2019). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results highlight this sensor as a unique, promising candidate for metastatic cancer diagnosis due to its remarkably low melanoma CTC detection limit, all within a portable device. 5.1.2. Detection of cell signalling proteins Detecting melanoma skin cancer via cell signalling proteins offers early, accurate diagnosis compared to traditional methods. These proteins impact cell adhesion, migration, cell cycle regulation, and intracellular trafficking, alterations to which may arise before visible changes manifest on the skin. Overcoming the reportedly low concentration of CD146, a melanoma-associated antigen, a novel immunosensor was created using aminated graphene (GS-NH2), mesoporous nano-Co3O4 sheets, and gold nanoparticles (AuNP/Co3O4) (Ren et al., 2014). The AuNP/Co3O4 in the immunosensor increased the contact surface area thus the electron transfer between the antibody and the AuNPs attached to the Co3O4, while the mesoporous Co3O4 nanosheet facilitated the capture of more biomolecules, thereby enhancing sensitivity via dual amplification. The recognition of CD146 was achieved with amperometry and EIS, demonstrating a broad linear range (0.01–15 ng/mL), with a low detection limit (3.4 pg/mL). The system was also evaluated in human serum, yielding satisfactory results and providing a promising approach for use in clinical diagnostics. C.

Biosensors and Bioelectronics 250 (2024) 116045 11 the activity of CDK4 (cyclin-dependent kinase 4), which is activated by binding to the specific protein cyclin D and is known to be dysregulated in 90% of melanomas (Prevel et al., 2016). Hyperactivation of CDK4, amplification of Cyclin D, or downregulation of the tumour suppressor protein p16INK4a, is linked to elevated risk of developing cutaneous melanoma. The peptide biosensor incorporates a sequence of fluo­ rescently labelled amino acids that is phosphorylated by CDK4/Cyclin D with specificity. Fluorescent activity was recorded in cell extracts, skin biopsies, and melanoma xenografts offering an alternative to immuno­ logical biorecognition. 5.1.3. Tyrosinase detection with signal enhancing modalities The development of biosensors that can sensitively monitor the levels of tyrosinase (TYR) has attracted the interest of many scientists. To address this issue Chenyue Zhan et al. created a fluorescent imaging probe (namely NBR-AP), to detect primary and metastatic melanoma in vitro (B16–F10 cells) and in vivo (rodent model) (Fig. 7b) (Zhan et al., 2018). The probe consists of a hydroxyphenyl-urea group (enzyme substrate) combined with a fluorescent dye phenoxazine derivative, which acts as a signal reporter activating the probe in the presence of tyrosinase through an oxidation process, which sequentially leads to the breakdown of the urea linkage and emission of fluorescence. The NBR-AP probe showed a strong direct correlation between fluorescence intensity and tyrosinase concentration, ranging from 0 to 200 U/mL (Zhan et al., 2018). During in vivo studies, per the fluorescence intensity, the levels of tyrosinase in the cancerous areas were determined to be much higher than in unaffected tissues. Kumar et al. studied the speci­ ficity of two turn-on-off fluorescent probes founded on naphthalimide derivatives with mono and dihydroxy phenol groups, as these groups have been shown to have a high affinity for tyrosinase (Kumar et al., 2020). They can detect elevated levels of tyrosinase, ranging from 5 U to 10 U, rapidly, with fluorescence reaching full quenching within 5 min. The probes are able to detect tyrosinase at nanomolar concentrations (2 nM) and can be used for live-cell fluorescence imaging as shown by in vitro studies. Carbon quantum dots are attractive for biosensing applications, especially for cancer detection, due to their small size, strong fluores­ cence properties, biocompatibility, and ease of synthesis. Lujing Chai et al. worked on a highly selective biosensor for monitoring TYR activity based on biocompatible dopamine-functionalized carbon quantum dots (Dopa-CQDs) as fluorescence probes (Chai et al., 2015). The working principle of the assay relies on the catalytic oxidization of the dopamine molecules in Dopa-CQDs by tyrosinase, which leads to the formation of a dopaquinone derivative, resulting in an electron transfer between the CQDs and dopaquinone (Fig. 7c) (Chai et al., 2015). This process results in fluorescence quenching. The quantitative evaluation of tyrosinase activity corresponded to the fluorescence quenching efficiency. The assay was linear range from 23.2 × 10−3 to 793.5 × 10−3 U/mL with a detection limit of 7 × 10−3 U/mL. The results also showed that the Dopa-CQD system is biocompatible and can effectively detect changes in Fig. 7.

Biosensors and Bioelectronics 250 (2024) 116045 12 tyrosinase levels within melanoma cells. Working under the same principle, J.J. Hu et al. expanded the linear response in the range of 0.711–2.925 U/mL with a detection limit of 17.7 × 10−3 U/mL (Hu et al., 2017). Except for carbon quantum dots, gold nanoclusters have been implemented for tyrosinase sensing. X. Yang et al. synthesized a novel fluorescent probe for tyrosinase detection consisting of gold nano­ clusters stabilized with L-tyrosine (AuNCs-Tyr) (Yang et al., 2014). The affinity between L-tyrosine and tyrosine was due to the stabilizing effect of L-tyrosine on the gold nanoclusters and the specific interaction be­ tween tyrosine and tyrosinase during catalytic reactions. The determi­ nation of tyrosinase activity was based on the aggregation of AuNCs@Tyr on the active sites of the enzyme, leading to the quenching of their fluorescence. Tyrosinase activity was determined linearly from 0.5 to 200 U/mL with a sensitivity of 0.08 U/mL, without yet having been tested in clinically relevant conditions. Researchers developed a ratiometric fluorescent technique using glutathione-protected AuNCs to measure tyrosinase concentration and catalysed dopamine in a linear range of 0.006–3.6 U/mL and 1.0 nM to 1.0 mM, respectively (Teng et al., 2015). Another approach for determining tyrosinase presence based on dopamine-modified gold-silver nanoclusters (Dopa-Au/Ag NCs) bioconjugated with a fluorophore agent was introduced by H. Ao et al., (2016). Upon the oxidization of dopamine in the presence of tyrosinase, electron transfer occurs between the NCs and o-dopaquinone, leading to fluorescence quenching (Stoitchkov et al., 2002). The acquired fluorescence signal offered a quantitative evalua­ tion of tyrosinase levels from 0.045 to 0.3195 U/mL with a detection limit of 0.0135 U/mL (Ao et al., 2016). Diagnosis of malignant melanoma has also been studied in correla­ tion to the DOPA/Tyrosinase ratio, an indicator supported by clinical studies (Stoitchkov et al., 2002). Based on this data, S.B. Revin and S.A. John developed an electrochemical marker on glassy carbon able to investigate the DOPA/Ty ratio in serum samples with cyclic voltam­ metry by deploying a pAMTa electrode which could successfully prevent biofouling (Revin and John, 2013). The signal increased linearly as DOPA and tyrosinase levels augmented in the range of 10−8-10−4 M and 5 × 10−8-10−4 M, respectively, with detection limit of tyrosinase cor­ responding to 1.9 × 10−10 M. As recent biosensing technologies have shifted towards minimally invasive detection methods, Ciui et al. developed a minimally invasive microneedle biosensor for decentralized cutaneous melanoma screening, using TYR detection (Fig. 8a and b) (Ciui et al., 2018). Hollow microneedles, produced via 3D printing, were polished with graphite-enriched carbon paste and functionalized with the catechol (CAT) substrate which was constrained in a conductive hydrophilic gel serving as an electrochemical cell (Fig. 8c and d). The base of the microneedles was connected to a transduction system of flexible elec­ tronics. This biosensor, based on current signals generated by Fig. 8.

Biosensors and Bioelectronics 250 (2024) 116045 13 TYR-induced CAT conversion to benzoquinone, exhibited promising sensitivity (slope: 4.6 μA/mg • mLTYR), for TYR detection (Fig. 8e). Ef­ forts could focus on clinical investigations to validate the efficacy of the sensor in different stages of skin cancer. Furthermore, a high-performance field-effect transistor-based biosensor (bio-FET) has been successfully developed by self-assembling nanostructured tetrapeptide tryptophan–valine–phenylalanine–tyrosine (WVFY) on n-type metal oxide transistors for tyrosinase detection (Fig. 9a) (Ren et al., 2022). The WVFY peptide has been used due to its ability to self-assemble onto the surface and serve as a recognition element for tyrosinase, which induces the conversion of the phenolic hydroxyl groups of the peptide to o-benzoquinone and a detectable potentiometric signal is generated. Ren et al. designed flexible wearable polyimide (PI)–based substrates to detect this signal with favourable mechanical properties for conformal skin attachment (Fig. 9b and c). The peptide-modified sensor presented a very low detection limit of 1.9 fM with a wide detection range of 10 fM-1nM, thus holding great potential for tyrosinase detection and melanoma screening while laying the groundwork for wearable cancer screening bio-FET technologies (Fig. 9d). This technology could also be employed for large-scale research studies aiming to quantify tyrosinase levels in distinct cancer stages, however, the accuracy of this approach should be further validated. Also, Wang et al. developed a novel SERS sensor, by assembling AuNPs and p-thiol catechol on an indium tin oxide electrode as the SERS substrate, for detecting TYR due to the spectral variation triggered by the catalysis of p-thiol catechol to p-thioquinone (Wang et al., 2019). The sensor exhibited rapid response (<1min), high selectivity, and low detection limit (0.07 U/mL). This portable device is a breakthrough of high importance as it can provide high sensitivity and specific by allowing the real-time detection of molecular vibrations unique to TYR, but it should be evaluated in complex biological samples. 5.1.4. Detection methods for S100B Multiple methods have been developed towards S100B, including electrochemical approaches and the functionalization of microneedles with an anti-human S100B detection antibody. X. Wang et al. developed an electrochemical assay for the detection of S100B in human blood samples utilizing the 1:2 binding ratio between the melanoma biomarker and a peptide that recognises with specificity S100B (Wang et al., 2014). A specific capture peptide enabled the biorecognition of S100B, while a signal peptide, that bonded with the protein due to the Gly-His-Lys modification, concurrently facilitated signal amplification and offered higher sensitivity. From studies performed in S100B doped samples under square wave voltammetry, a very low LOD (0.1 nM) and a positive correlation within the range of 0.1–25.6 nM were achieved, while almost 100% marker recovery was accomplished in serum sam­ ples. The recognition of S100B was also studied by researchers who developed an electrochemical immunosensor using a chitosan/reduced graphene oxide (CS–rGO) nanocomposite (Zhang et al., 2022a). The sensor worked by measuring the decreased current signal of electro­ chemical probes, resulting from the antigen-antibody complex forma­ tion at the electrode interface which increased steric hindrance. The nanocomposite offered excellent conductivity and biocompatibility, resulting in augmented stability, selectivity, sensitivity, and a wide range of 10 fg/mL to 1 μg/L, with a low LOD of 1.9 pg/mL, measured with differential pulse voltammetry. The sensor was tested on artificially protein-doped real human serum samples, demonstrating good reli­ ability with a recovery of S100B ranging from 97.4% to 105%. Totti et al. also extracted and detected S100B in situ on a 3D tissue-engineered Fig. 9. Flexible

Biosensors and Bioelectronics 250 (2024) 116045 14 disease model using microneedles functionalized with an anti-human S100B detection antibody (Totti et al., 2019). A novel blotting method was used to identify the captured S100B and subsequently the obtained amount of S100B was calculated by juxtaposing the blotting and coating pattern. Future research should enhance the reliability and efficiency of these clinical detection methods. 5.2. Nucleic acids towards melanoma detection A group of new nucleotide phosphoramidites synthesized and incorporated in DNA probes with pyrene-modified fluorescent phos­ phates was developed by P. Li et al., (2016). These probes exhibit decreased fluorescence due to the quenching effect of the nucleobases but emit a strong signal when a perfectly matched duplex is formatted. They were used as “on-off” fluorescence sensors for detecting single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and successfully detected a specific BRAF mutation in human melanoma during PCR applications via fluo­ rescence spectrophotometry. With a more advanced approach, Wueth­ rich et al. created a microcantilever-array-based method for directly detecting BRAF mutations in total RNA from melanoma cells without resorting to real-time polymerase methods (Fig. 7a) (Huber et al., 2013). By deploying an oligonucleotide probe that consists of a complementary sequence specific to BRAFV600Е, the assay can detect the mutation requiring only 20 ng/ml of RNA, thus advocating its suitability for clinical applications, while the surface stress generated upon detection is correlated to the concentration of the mutation (Huber et al., 2013). This methodology could facilitate and accelerate tumour identification, reducing treatment time. The parallel array format makes this cantilever method adaptable to other malignancies, offering comprehensive clin­ ical prognosis alongside melanoma screening. Considering the diag­ nostical importance of detecting the BRAF gene mutations, scientists developed an integrated multimolecular sensor (IMMS) to identify the distinct mutation BRAFV600Е in circulating melanoma cells from liquid biopsy samples (Wuethrich et al., 2021). An electrochemical transducer is coupled with melanoma-specific cell capture and lysis mechanisms to allow the detection of BRAFV600Е simultaneously at DNA and protein levels. The differential pulse voltammetry-based detection method relies on antigen identification by the surface-immobilized anti-BRAFV600E antibody with [Fe(CN)₆]⁴⁻ (Wuethrich et al., 2021). This device has been validated on plasma samples containing diagnostically relevant con­ centrations, hence it could pave the way for a new class of cancer bio­ sensors for multimolecular analysis of liquid biopsies. As evidence for the clinical utility of cell-free nucleic acids (cfNAs) in bodily fluids has accumulated, technologies that can identify them have immense potential for individualized diagnosis and disease advance­ ment. Specifically, the experimental data suggests that ISF contains comparable amounts of all RNA species, including miRs, previously discovered in the blood (Al Sulaiman et al., 2019). Sulaiman et al. developed a peptide-based hydrogel-coated microneedle patch to sam­ ple, isolate, and detect a DNA equivalent of miR-210 from skin inter­ stitial fluid (ISF) with sequence-specificity. The microneedles were functionalized with custom-designed peptide nucleic acid (PNA) fluo­ rescently labelled probes that were fixed to an alginate hydrogel matrix. The alginate hybrid PNA hydrogel allowed for rapid sampling and a significant fluid loading capacity of 6.5 μL within 2 min. With minimally invasive sampling of dermal ISF, the target DNA was hybridized with the PNA probe to a duplex whose fluorescence intensity was measured with a sensitivity of 6–500 nM, either on the patch or in a solution post-sampling. The importance of cell-free nucleic acids as informative biomarkers highlights the potential of automated and

sensitivity of 6–500 nM, either on the patch or in a solution post-sampling. The importance of cell-free nucleic acids as informative biomarkers highlights the potential of automated and minimally inva­ sive technologies for personalized diagnosis and continuous monitoring of disease progression in patients. 5.3. Olfactory detection of volatile organic compounds Canine olfactory detection of human diseases, starting with a 1989 report of a dog detecting melanoma in its owner, has gained increased attention (Williams and Pembroke, 1989). However, recent research indicates limitations in practicality (Bau¨er et al., 2022; Willis et al., 2016). Addressing the challenges of canine-based melanoma detection, electronic noses (e-noses) are emerging as promising alternatives, mimicking canine olfactory capabilities. E-noses detect volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and have shown promise in oncology diagnostics, albeit influenced by environmental factors (Scheepers et al., 2022). D’Amico et al. developed a method for VOC detection in skin lesions, achieving 80% prediction accuracy using an array of seven quartz mi­ crobalance (QMB) chemical sensors (D’Amico et al., 2008). Their work showcased discernible gas chromatogram disparities in skin surface samples’ headspace, collected from dermatology patients, distinguish­ ing melanoma from nevus. The sensors gauged resonant frequency shifts proportional to gas-absorbed molecule mass, contributing to distinct patterns suitable for classification via pattern-recognition algorithms. Nevertheless, a comprehensive review of 208 studies from 1984 to 2020 revealed limited research on melanoma detection through e-noses, highlighting challenges and potential for improvement (Gouzerh et al., 2022). 5.4. Other biosensing approaches for detecting melanoma VEGF has been also explored by May et al. by creating a cell-based biosensor for prompt diagnosis of metastatic melanoma in blood sam­ ples (May et al., 2005). The cellulose triacetate membrane of an ion-selective electrode, whose responsiveness increased proportionally to the VEGF content, was covered and incubated with a confluent monolayer of melanoma cells. The biosensor demonstrated a detection limit of 70 pg/mL equivalent to 210 M, indicating that it could for quantifying the levels of VEGF in blood samples from advanced cancer patients. Based on the electrochemical signal generated by the interaction of the antigen MAGE-I and its corresponding antibody when immobilized on an indium tin oxide electrode (ITO), a novel low-cost immunosensor was created for the rapid identification of melanoma cancer (Gundogdu et al., 2017). By deploying electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and single frequency impedance (SFI) to investigate the antigen-antibody interactions, A. Gündogdu et al. managed to design an immunosensor that exhibits a low detection limit of 1.30 fg/mL as well as wide linear range from 4 to 200 fg/mL for MAGE-1 detection in human serum sample. By adding a layer of 3-Gly­ cidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane (3-GOPS), B. Demirbakan and M.K. Sez­ gintürk created an immunosensor functioning on the same principles, rendering the sensor reusable since no cross-linking agent was required (Demirbakan and Sezginturk, 2017). Studies with human serum samples suggested that the biosensor could accurately recognize the protein using inexpensive disposable ITO electrodes instead of costly procedures like ELISA, with a relatively broad determination range of 0.5–15 fg/mL. Silicon quantum dots (SiQDs) have been used as photoluminescence biosensors to detect LDH activity, known to catalyse the Lactate + NAD → LDHPyruvate + NADH + H+ reaction (Zhou et al., 2022). The fluo­ rescence of SiQDs in this system was first quenched by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) due to NADH diffusion to the SiQDs sur­ face, resulting in an electron transfer (ET) process, and then recovered by adding LDH, which catalytically consumed NAD.

dinucleotide (NADH) due to NADH diffusion to the SiQDs sur­ face, resulting in an electron transfer (ET) process, and then recovered by adding LDH, which catalytically consumed NAD. Despite the high selectivity, the linear detectable concentration range was 770–385,000 U/L, implying that the assay could be used to analyse LDH in human serum samples only as a prognostic indicator for melanoma patients. Keum et al. developed a microneedle-based biosensor device inte­ grated with an endomicroscope for simultaneous imaging and biosensor- based diagnosis of metastatic melanoma by detecting nitric oxide (NO) (Fig. 10a) (Keum et al., 2015). The microneedles are capable of detecting NO signals in real-time with high carrier mobility and sensi­ tivity, allowing for the efficient detection of sub-micromolar E. Chatzilakou et al.

The electrochemical biosensor consists of a microneedle array equipped with electrodes and coated with the con­ ducting polymer polyaniline (PANI) (Fig. 10b). It enables the diffusion of cancer cells and reaction with the immobilized NO-specific probe, resulting in a change in the electrical current in real-time. The in vivo dual-diagnostic device was able to distinguish the difference in NO levels between cancerous and healthy tissues in melanoma mouse skin and colon areas with a LOD of 1 × 10−6 M, suggesting its potential as a combinational tool for melanoma diagnosis (Fig. 10c and d). 6. Summary and conclusions Research targets non-invasive diagnosis using accessible body fluids with identified melanoma biomarkers (Belter et al., 2017; Gerloff et al., 2020). Yet, complexity and varied microenvironments hinder an optimal biomarker. Challenges include variability in collection, pro­ cessing, and demographics (Friedel et al., 2023). Most biosensors focus on metastatic melanoma, but equal attention is needed for early primary melanoma detection expressed as an individualized fold-change differ­ ence. A summary of biosensors which are advancing melanoma miti­ gation is presented in Table 2, facilitating a critical comparison. Additionally, the emergence of wearable biosensing technologies offers a unique opportunity in this space (Yetisen et al., 2018). These wearable devices, which can monitor various physiological markers and skin conditions in real-time, have the potential to revolutionize the early detection and continuous monitoring of melanoma (Ciui et al., 2018). This review uniquely synthesizes recent breakthroughs in biosensing technologies, highlighting their transformative role in advancing mel­ anoma diagnosis and patient care. Advances in biosensing tech offer the potential for improving medical diagnosis and treatment. Optical bio­ sensors, often preferred for their high sensitivity and low susceptibility to interferences, have been integrated with nanomaterials for quanti­ tative results, particularly in melanoma detection (Chai et al., 2015; Hu et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2014). Real-time and liquid biopsy methods show promise for micromelanoma detection and disease monitoring (Zambito et al., 2022). Cell signalling proteins enhance early diagnosis and intraoperative melanoma detection, improving outcomes (Day et al., 2013). Biosensors combined with photodynamic therapy offer theragnostic benefits for melanoma care, addressing socioeconomic disparities in diagnosis and treatment (Viraka Nellore et al., 2014). Microneedles enable diagnosis and treatment at the site, and bioreceptor-transducer combinations enhance sensitivity and accuracy (Al Sulaiman et al., 2019; Keum et al., 2015; Madden et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2022). Some biosensing tech focuses on tumour identification by detecting mutations and gene overexpression in suspicious tissue sam­ ples, serving as adjunctive tools for histopathological diagnosis (Fior­ avanti et al., 2016; Huber et al., 2013). Others aim for a definitive diagnosis without the need for tissue samples (Demirbakan and Sez­ ginturk, 2017; Gundogdu et al., 2017; May et al., 2005). Portable de­ vices, including SERS and lab-on-chip systems, enable POC testing, enhancing early disease detection (Anu Prathap et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2014). These breakthroughs confirm that biosensing techniques offer significant public health benefits by increasing the accuracy of early detection cost-effectively and efficiently. The development of clinically validated end-to-end conclusive diagnostic devices using biosensing technologies holds great potential for POC melanoma diagnosis. 7.

To address disparities, a comprehensive and unbiased dataset is crucial for training AI-supported algorithms, encompassing the wide-ranging population affected by melanoma (Schlessinger et al., 2019). This effort is essential to address disparities in disease presentation and mortality rates among minority populations. In addition, the role of wearable biosensors in melanoma detection and management is an area ripe for exploration (Ciui et al., 2018). These technologies could allow for continuous, non-invasive monitoring of skin health, potentially leading to earlier detection and more personal­ ized treatment plans.

However, most approaches lack clinical inputs supported by dermatologists that could aid in higher accuracy and explainability. To dermatologists, the presence of telangiectasia, or narrow blood vessels that typically appear serpiginous or arborizing, is a critical indicator of basal cell carcinoma (BCC). Exploiting the feature information present in telangiectasia through a combination of DL-based techniques could create a pathway for both, improving DL results as well as aiding dermatologists in BCC diagnosis. This study demonstrates a novel “fusion” technique for BCC vs non-BCC classification using ensemble learning on a combination of (a) handcrafted features from semantically segmented telangiectasia (U-Net- based) and (b) deep learning features generated from whole lesion images (EfficientNet-B5-based). This fusion method achieves a binary classification accuracy of 97.2%, with a 1.3% improvement over the corresponding DL-only model, on a holdout test set of 395 images. An increase of 3.7% in sensitivity, 1.5% in specificity, and 1.5% in precision along with an AUC of 0.99 was also achieved. Metric improvements were demonstrated in three stages: (1) the addition of handcrafted telangiectasia features to deep learning features, (2) including areas near telangiectasia (surround areas), (3) discarding the noisy lower-importance features through feature importance. Another novel approach to feature finding with weak annota- tions through the examination of the surrounding areas of telangiectasia is offered in this study. The experimental results show state-of-the-art accuracy and precision in the diagnosis of BCC, compared to three benchmark techniques. Further exploration of deep learning techniques for individual dermoscopy feature detection is warranted. Keywords Basal cell carcinoma · Deep learning · Fusion · Telangiectasia · Transfer learning · Dermoscopy Introduction Basal cell carcinoma is one of the two most common types of skin cancer in the USA, with over two million new cases diagnosed yearly [1]. Dermatologists usually diagnose BCC by visual inspection. However, certain benign lesions can be confused with BCC and cause an unnecessary biopsy. Automating this diagnosis and ensuring early detection will reduce the burden on patients and healthcare professionals and produce more accurate results [2, 3]. Deep learning methodologies applied to dermoscopy images have yielded high diagnostic accuracy, now exceed- ing that of dermatologists [3–5]. Skin cancer diagnosis from images has advanced by implementing fusion ensembles, metadata, and some handcrafted features [6–10]. It is only pertinent to expand and explore the intersection of visually and clinically apparent features with deep learning tech- niques for disease detection. Telangiectasia or thin arborizing vessels within the lesion is a crucial factor for dermatologists when looking for BCC. Their detection, either by visual inspection or any computational method, can provide pathways to make BCC diagnosis more accurate. Cheng et al.

1138 Journal of Imaging Informatics in Medicine (2024) 37:1137–1150 semantic segmentation of these blood vessels. Semantically segmented precise binary masks provide means to effec- tively quantify the vessel feature information. There are very few image processing or deep learning studies that utilize these vascular structures to diagnose BCC. Cheng et al. [15] used an adaptive critic design approach to discriminate vessels from competing structures, enabling BCC classification. Kharazmi et al. [16] utilize features extracted from these vascular structures to clas- sify BCC using a random forest classifier. Kharazmi et al. [17] learned from sparse autoencoders, combined them with patient profile information and fed them to a Softmax clas- sifier for BCC diagnosis. Recently, Serrano et.al [18] used clustering-based color features and GCLM-based texture features to train VGG16 and MLP models to extract deep learning features that they use to train another MLP model. The final MLP classifies lesions with either the presence or absence of one of seven BCC patterns, providing BCC clas- sification. None of these studies utilizes deep learning–based vessel segmentation and classification together to achieve a BCC diagnosis. Through our fusion of telangiectasia and deep learning features, we also demonstrate how clinically observable features can be tracked better with deep learning and ultimately contribute to an improvement in diagnosis. In this study, state-of-the-art accuracy in BCC classifica- tion was achieved by making the following unique contribu- tions: (1) clinically inspired and explainable BCC diagnosis with deep learning–based telangiectasia mask generation as an intermediate step, (2) an ensemble learning classifier uti- lizing a hybrid input feature set consisting of object, shape, and color telangiectasia features integrated with deep learn- ing features. Materials and Methods Image Datasets The skin lesion images used in this study come from three datasets: the HAM10000 dataset (ISIC 2018) of Tschandl et al. [19], a publicly available skin lesion dermoscopy dataset containing over 10,000 skin images for seven diag- nostic categories, the ISIC 2019 dataset [19–21], and data- sets R43 from NIH studies CA153927-01 and CA101639- 02A2 [22]. For training the U-Net model that generates telangiectasia masks, 127 images were selected from the HAM10000 data- set, 90 images from the ISIC 2019 dataset, and 783 images from the NIH study dataset, leading to a total of 1000 BCC images. The ISIC 2019 dataset included a few repeat images, omitted from our BCC dataset. The ground truth binary ves- sel masks were manually drawn by our team and verified by a dermatologist (WVS). The BCC dataset and the ground truth masks are shown in Fig. 1. For the non-BCC dataset, we selected 1000 images from the HAM10000 dataset from five benign categories: benign keratosis, nevus, actinic kera- tosis, dermatofibroma, and vascular lesion. The distribution for each category is shown in Fig. 2. The five categories represent the five most common benign skin conditions. Since this is a binary classification, the BCC vs non-BCC categories are balanced (1000 each). In the 1000 image non- BCC dataset, the categories maintain the same ratio as in the original HAM dataset which is illustrated in Fig. 2b. The images are 8-bit RGB of size 450 × 600 from the HAM10000 dataset and 1024 × 768 from the NIH study dataset. All the images are resized to 448 × 448 before training. Fig. 1 Left to right, first row: the first two images are BCC from the HAM10000 (ISIC2018) dataset; the last two images are BCC from the NIH study dataset. The second row presents telangiectasia overlays for the images in the first row

1139 Journal of Imaging Informatics in Medicine (2024) 37:1137–1150 For both U-Net and EfficientNet-based models’ training, standard train-test splits of 80–20 were used. The training set was further split 80–20 to create a validation set. For BCC classification, the images were randomly selected, leading to subsets of 1288 for training, 324 for validation, and 395 for testing. For the U-Net model, the training set consisted of 650 images, the validation set comprised 162 images, and the test set included 195 images. These 195 BCC images combined with 200 non-BCC images make up the holdout test set for the BCC model. Data Augmentation For medical datasets with relatively few examples and a lack of variation, data augmentation helps create more training samples. Augmentation provides deep learning models the ability to generalize and hence provides regularization with- out overfitting. For both the U-Net and EfficientNet-based BCC classification models, the geometric augmentations include rotation ranging from + 30 to − 30° in reflect mode (to not distort the vessels) horizontal and vertical flip, width shift with a range of (− 0.2, + 0.2), height shift with a range of (− 0.2, + 0.2), and shear with a range (− 0.2, + 0.2). These geometric augmentations are shown in Fig. 3. The number of images in each class before and after augmentation is shown in Table 1. Colors of skin lesions contain important distinguishing information and augmenting the original color of the lesions may ultimately make their classification harder. However, for telangiectasia, color augmentations can help fix the issue of vessels and red-pigmented skin being similar in color. Hence, color augmentations were utilized for training the U-Net model on the telangiectasia dataset to generate ves- sel masks, but not applied to the DL model responsible for calculating skin lesion features. For the U-Net model, his- togram stretching to each color channel was applied, fol- lowed by contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization, normalization, and brightness enhancement [14], as shown in Fig. 4. Due to the narrowness of the vessels, all the ves- sel masks are dilated with a 3 × 3 structuring element and closed with a 2 × 2 structuring element, as shown in Fig. 4. This dilation prevents the vessels in the masks from being broken when augmented. Since the goal is to identify ves- sels within the lesion, the vessel masks are multiplied with U-Net-generated lesion masks to yield vessels only within the lesion. For both models, the images were square-cropped and then resized to 448 × 448. Proposed Methodology Our proposed methodology integrates clinically relevant handcrafted features of telangiectasia with high-level Fig 2 a From left, first row: benign keratosis, nevus, actinic keratosis; from left second row: dermatofibroma and vascular lesion. b Number of images from each category used in the non-BCC dataset.

1140 Journal of Imaging Informatics in Medicine (2024) 37:1137–1150 features extracted from a pre-trained deep learning model according to a feature importance score determined by the average Gini impurity decrease. We then utilize the higher predictive ability of ensemble learning methods to feed this hybrid feature set to a random forest classifier and create our novel fusion BCC diagnosis technique. Our method includes the following main components: • Semantically segmenting telangiectasia with a U-Net- based model to yield a binary vessel mask. • Applying image processing and statistical methods to cal- culate descriptive vessel features based on the objects in the vessel mask. • Extracting high-level deep learning features from fine- tuning a pre-trained EfficientNet-based model. • Calculating the feature importance score for all the features and selecting only the top-most features above a threshold. • Classifying the skin lesions into BCC or non-BCC using a random forest classifier trained on the hybrid feature set. Our methodology is illustrated in Fig. 5. Semantic Segmentation of Telangiectasia In recent years, U-Net- [23] based semantic segmentation models have been the go-to for biomedical segmentation. Our vessel detection deep learning model is based on the U-Net model in [14] that generates binary vessel masks as the output. Distinguishing thin arborizing telangiectasia from sun damage telangiectasia which is sometimes pre- sent in benign skin lesions is a difficult task [11]. To add to this, since vessels occupy only 2–10% of the skin lesion image; it is quite a challenging task even for deep learn- ing models. A combination loss function used in the U-Net model addresses this issue of severe class imbalance [14]. It is important to note that in cases of sun damage, the telan- giectasia patterns are usually simpler and tend to be wider, shorter, and less defined, exhibit more variability in width, and are less densely clustered compared to those observed in BCC [11]. Hence, for training the U-Net model, only BCC images were used, since our goal is to find BCC indicat- ing telangiectasia. For testing, masks were generated from the trained U-Net model for both the BCC and non-BCC datasets. As shown later, the U-Net model was able to find vessels in both BCC and non-BCC categories. The distin- guishing properties are captured through the image process- ing operations explained in the next section. Handcrafted Feature Generation from Vessel Masks Traditional image processing techniques provide several tools to calculate telangiectasia features explicitly. Fea- tures are generated using objects in the vessel mask. From Maurya et al. [14], annotations for telangiectasia suffer from interobserver variability, fine or blurry telangiec- tasia, and poor contrast in images. There may be missed vessels along the boundary of annotations that need to be included. Also, regions surrounding the vessels can be helpful in differentiating basal cell carcinoma [11]. To include these probable missed features, we generate a sur- round mask for the vessel objects. Every object from the vessel mask is extracted and dilated with a disk structuring element of radius 12 (d1) and radius 5 (d2), resulting in two dilation variants of the object. Removing d2 from d1 gives the object surround mask, as shown in Fig. 6. We calculate a total of 80 vessel features that include information about vessel color, geometry, shape, and statis- tical measure related to those features. Table 2 explains the handcrafted features we generated. Features 1 to 8 are gen- eral vessel descriptors [11]. Features 1–4 represent BCC’s narrower, longer, and more numerous vessels. Eccentricity features 5–8 are calculated to account for straighter BCC vessel structures. For the example images shown in Fig. 6, 347 and 240 vessel objects are detected. The figure shows surround masks generated for two such vessel objects. Fea- tures 5 to 8 are calculated for the surround

Features 13 to 22 include the number of objects calculated after morphologically eroding the final vessel mask with a circular structuring element of radius from 1 to 10. Features 23 to 32 include the area of objects calculated after morphologically eroding the final vessel mask with a circular structuring element of radius from 1 to 10. Features 33 to 44 are color features for vessels. Features 45 to 56 are color features in the HSV plane and features 57 to 80 are features 33 to 56 (RGB and HSV features) applied to the surround of vessel objects. Feature Vectors from EfficientNet To calculate deep learning features, we use a pre-trained EfficientNet model. EfficientNets are a series of convolu- tional neural network models introduced by Tan et al. [24] that uniformly scale all network depth, width, or resolution dimensions by a compounding coefficient. These models achieved state-of-art top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet [25] dataset with fewer parameters. Their primary building block is a mobile inverted bottleneck called MBConv. The fam- ily of EfficientNet networks has different numbers of these MBConv blocks. The EfficientNetB5 model consists of two main blocks: MBConv1 and MBConv6. The detailed struc- tures of these blocks are shown in Fig. 7. The MBConv block or the inverted residual block improved the MobileNet [26] or residual blocks and fol- lowed a narrow- > wide- > narrow approach, which means that the connections in the MBConv blocks move from one bottleneck to another, using a residual connection. The basic MBConv block implements the following operations: 1 × 1 convolution that expands the dimensionality from the nar- row channels to wider channels, a 3 × 3 or 5 × 5 channel-wise or depth-wise convolution operation to get output features, ultimately followed by another 1 × 1 convolution that down- samples the number of channels to the initial value. Since this output block and the initial block have the same dimen- sionality, they are added together. The primary purpose of the Squeeze operation is to extract global information from each of the channels of an image. Each block starts with a feature transformation on an image X to get features U, which are then squeezed to a single value using global aver- age pooling [24]. This output is then fed to a fully connected layer followed by a ReLU function to add nonlinearity and reduce complexity. From here, another fully connected layer followed by a sigmoid function performs the excitation oper- ation to get per-channel weights. The final output is achieved by rescaling these feature maps U with these activations. Since the original EfficientNet-B5 model was built for ten-class classification, we remove the top layers to add a Fig. 5 Proposed architecture employing a fusion of deep learning and handcrafted features from vessels for BCC classification Fig. 6 Object surround masks: Top row from left: example lesion image 1 with telangiec- tasia, its ground truth mask, its surround mask for object 1 (the contiguous connected vessel area), its surround mask for object 2 (the vessel on the bottom right).

For our model, the ini- tial input image size is 448 × 448 × 3. Our model contains 14 different stages and is used first for classification, followed by feature extraction with the trained model. For the classification stage, we start with a 3 × 3 filter convolution, batch normalization, and swish activation function reducing the image dimensions in half from 448 to 224 and increasing the channels from 3 to 48. Hence, the feature map dimensions are 224 × 224 × 48. Stage 2 consists of three layers of an MBConv1 block with a 3 × 3 filter that maintains the previous stage resolution but decreases the number of channels, resulting in a feature map of size 224 × 224 × 24. Stages 3 (5 layers), 4 (5 lay- ers), and 5 (7 layers) use three MBConv6 blocks each of kernel size 5 × 5 continuously reducing the resolution but increasing the feature map size to 28 × 28 × 128 (end of stage 5).

At stage 9, a 1 × 1 convolution with 2048 filters results in a feature map of size 14 × 14 × 2048. Stages 10 and 11 apply batch normalization and Softmax activa- tion retaining the feature size as the previous layer. Stage 12 uses global average pooling to bring the resolution to 2048, followed by a dropout (stage 13) and dense layer (stage 14) leading to the final classification. The model is fine-tuned after the 200th layer, and the best model is saved. We per- form feature extraction at stage 12 after the global average pooling layer, thereby resulting in a 2048-size feature vector for the training, validation, and test sets. The stages, opera- tions, resolutions, channels, and layers are shown in Table 3. Random Forest for Feature Importance and Final Classification The 80 feature vectors calculated from the vessel masks and the 2048 feature vector from the EfficientNet model are ranked according to a random forest feature importance algo- rithm determined by the average Gini impurity decrease [27]. Once the most relevant features are selected, we employ dif- ferent combinations of these fusion feature sets to a random forest classifier to yield the final classification result. Training Details All models were built using Keras with a TensorFlow back- end in Python 3.7 and trained using a single 32 GB Nvidia V100 graphics card. The training and network parameters for the U-Net model generating the vessel masks are taken from [14]. The EfficientNet-B5 model is fine-tuned after the 200th layer. Hyperparameter information is given in Table 4.

Deep Learning Training Results from Fine‑Tuning We achieved the best deep learning results from the Efficient- Net-B5 baseline model. The weights after layer 200 were unfrozen, and the model was fine-tuned to our binary BCC vs. non-BCC classification. The preliminary transfer learning model converged at 100 epochs and took nine more epochs to converge after fine-tuning. Figure 9 shows the loss and accu- racy curves for the training and validation sets. The validation and test set accuracies were 95.9% and 95.2%, respectively. After the model is trained, the 2048 length feature vector is extracted for the training, validation, and test sets. Feature Importance with Random Forest Feature importance is calculated for deep learning and handcrafted features using the random forest classifier [27]. The selection of key features results in models requiring optimal computational complexity while ensuring reduced generalization error due to noise intro- duced by less important features. The top 50 deep learn- ing features with an importance score greater than 0.005, and the top 23 handcrafted features with an importance score greater than 0.01 are selected. Figure 10 shows the selected features with their importance scores. From Fig. 10b, we observe that the most important hand- crafted features generally include the area of vessel objects, number of vessel objects, vessel eccentricity features, and color values of the vessel objects and the surrounding area. Final Classification with Deep Learning and Random Forest Classifier Table 5 shows six different fusion models that we tested. The different models are based on the following two selec- tion criteria: • Pretrained model used for extracting deep learning features: (a) EfficientNetB5, EfficientNetB0, and InceptionV3. • Feature set size: Fig. 9 Loss (a) and accuracy (b) plots before and after fine-tuning the EfficientNet-B5-based model Fig. 10 Importance scores for deep learning (a) and handcrafted features (b)

We achieve the best scores across all metrics with our Fusion 2 model that uses select critical features extracted from the fine-tuned EfficientNet-B5 model and handcrafted features extracted from vessel masks that feed a random for- est classifier to yield a final classification result. We achieve an accuracy of 0.972, sensitivity of 0.979, specificity of 0.965, and precision of 0.965. We achieve an AUC of 0.995. Table 6 shows the improvements in metrics as we move from the fine-tuned EfficientNet-B5 model to our fusion model. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and preci- sion improve by 1.3%, 3.7%, 1.5%, and 1.5%, respectively, suggesting the importance of adding handcrafted features. Omitting the surround features from the list of handcrafted features drops the AUC slightly, from 0.995 to 0.993. The confusion matrix is shown in Fig. 11. Performance Comparison with Existing Vessel‑Based BCC Detection We compared the performance of our proposed fusion model with three other published results [16–18]. Table 7 lists the datasets, fea- tures, classifiers, and scoring metrics for the models. We achieve better accuracy and precision values with our method (bold) than the existing best values. All the methods listed except ours use some type of color and texture features; only ours semantically segments telangiectasia as an intermediate step. Discussion A crucial clue for the clinical diagnosis of basal cell car- cinoma is the presence of telangiectasia within the lesion. Classical image processing methods to detect these vessels in this study used statistical measures to quantify telangiec- tasia features. These measures included characteristics such as color values relative to the surrounding lesion area [11] or independent component analysis of melanin and hemo- globin components followed by thresholding and clustering [17]. From these vessel masks, different color, texture, and shape features are calculated. Our group used a deep learn- ing–based U-Net model to detect these vessel masks with high accuracy vs. ground truth, obtaining a mean Jaccard score within the variation of human observers [14]. Recently, deep learning methods achieved superior results for detecting features such as hair [30] and globules [31]. From these deep learning–generated masks, classical fea- tures are calculated with the assumption that if the masks are more accurate, the features will be as well. Developing a single model for diagnosis without extracting individual features from whole images using pre-trained deep learn- ing models also has been used extensively. However, it is impossible to know which features the deep learning model deems more important, contributing to its black-box nature. Our structure-based detection model partially remedies this shortcoming by detecting specific features. Moreover, this report shows improved diagnostic accuracy for BCC vs. non- BCC classification by combining deep learning and classical features with ensemble learning.

1147 Journal of Imaging Informatics in Medicine (2024) 37:1137–1150 Figure 8 displays the advantages of the method presented here. Benign lesions have fewer vessels, and the total ves- sel area is less, as shown in columns 2 and 4 of Fig. 8. The number of vessel areas and their total number figure promi- nently in the most discriminatory features obtained from these masks, as shown in Fig. 10b. Eccentricity and color of objects found, all critical features of telangiectasia, are also crucial handcrafted features derived from these masks. We achieve state-of-the-art results with this approach that are better than deep learning or traditional image processing results, indicating promise for our structure-based detection model. We also achieve clinically explainable results, open- ing similar pathways to solve other diagnostic challenges. Our results also confirm the superiority of ensemble learn- ing methods for selecting a robust feature combination that improves the model’s accuracy. As seen from Table 5, all metrics improve when the features with higher importance scores are used. Another observation concerns the recent study by Serrano et al. [18]. The authors used different BCC features to annotate images with the presence or absence of features. We achieve a similar AUC but slightly better accu- racy with our proposed model, using only a single automati- cally segmented BCC structure: telangiectasia. Due to this added local pixel information, our results achieve state-of- the-art accuracy automatically without observing and anno- tating every single pattern that may or may not be present. In previous work, we determined significant interobserver variability in vessel annotation [14]. However, DL can learn to detect structures with more consistency than those pro- viding the masks for DL training. Thus, DL appears to be able to generalize from limited and inexact data sets and can detect vessel-like structures in different kinds of skin lesions, not just BCC.

1148 Journal of Imaging Informatics in Medicine (2024) 37:1137–1150 non-BCC images. Once the telangiectasia is detected, dis- tinguishing qualities in BCC vessels (thinness, arborizing) are captured when we calculate the handcrafted features as indicated in Table 2. Using handcrafted features also helps us distinguish between vessels present outside the lesion, as they do not contribute to BCC diagnosis. To account for the missed vessels due to blurry bounda- ries [14], our introduction of surround-area features also leads to an overall improvement in the AUC value. For seg- mentation problems, surround area detection by boundary expansion is a novel solution to feature finding that can con- tribute to better classification. There are several limitations of this work. The vessel mask marking was supervised by a single dermatologist (WVS). Only one team observer (one of AM, DS, SS, or WVS) annotated each mask. The final sensitivity was less than for the study by Serrano et al.; however, the overall accuracy was higher. Even though there is a lot of inter- section among the datasets of similar studies, the lack of a shared dataset with ground truths makes it harder to establish a true benchmark comparison. Hence, through this research, we share our telangiectasia masks and images openly [32]. All the comparable studies discussed, that employ deep learning models, including ours, do not include statistical significance tests. Selecting the most appropriate hypoth- esis testing in deep learning is challenging and is time as well as resource-consuming. The focus in deep learning has been more on predictive accuracy and model generaliza- tion rather than mean comparison among groups. However, research is progressing for the selection of appropriate sta- tistical significance tests for model selection in machine learning. The datasets in our study as well as the ones in all comparable studies also lack diversity in skin color which limits their scope. Conclusion and Future Work This study proposes a telangiectasia-based fusion model approach for classifying BCC vs. non-BCC lesion images. To train our vessel identification model’s deep learning (U-Net) arm, we developed telangiectasia masks for 1000 BCC images, available at [32]. No such telangiectasia over- lay database for BCC currently exists. Using the results from [14], we calculate the color and texture features from telangiectasia vessel masks and deep learning fea- tures learned from the EfficientNet-B5 model to yield a final classification result. Using a random forest model to combine features of each model provides a framework for fusion models. Our fusion model outperforms past BCC classification models in precision and accuracy, over a larger dataset than in previous studies, one that is publicly available. Our state- of-the-art accuracy demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed fusion techniques for this medical dataset. Our results produce more explainable results than whole-image deep learning results as we target clinically observable and relevant telangiectasia features. The current study is the only one, to the best of our knowledge, that uses semantically generated telangiectasia vessel features for BCC diagnosis. In the future, we would like to continue this research by including more clinical features for our fusion model and employing additional statistical techniques to account for significant differences as well as ANOVA with appropriate post hoc tests. Nonetheless, as demonstrated in this study, for medical image datasets that are limited in size/quality, fusion techniques can offer a way to establish state-of-the- art diagnostic models and increase explainability as well as clinical confidence in results.

O’Connell2 · Jennifer Choe3 Accepted: 11 June 2024 / Published online: 2 July 2024 © The Author(s) 2024 Abstract Purpose of Review This review provides an update on approved and emerging systemic therapies in the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non-melanoma skin cancers (squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, Merkel cell carcinoma). Recent Findings Many studies demonstrate the effectiveness of immunotherapy for all types of non-melanoma skin cancer. For basal cell carcinoma (BCC), hedgehog inhibitors (HHI) remain first-line but with poor tolerability. Numerous clinical trials studying both neoadjuvant and adjuvant use of anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 therapies in advanced NMSC are under investigation. Summary There is a growing number of systemic therapies available to treat non-melanoma skin cancers. The advent of immunotherapy has revolutionized the field and greatly improved survival compared to historical survival rates with cyto- toxic chemotherapy. Keywords Squamous cell carcinoma · Basal cell carcinoma · Merkel cell carcinoma · Immunotherapy · Neoadjuvant Introduction Non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) is a term used to describe a broad range of skin malignancies. It most com- monly includes keratinocyte carcinomas: cutaneous squa- mous cell carcinoma (CSCC) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC), but also includes Merkel cell carcinomas (MCC). There are approximately 5.4 million cases of NMSC each year, 80% of which occur in people aged 60 years or older [1, 2]. NMSC is the most common cancer type by incidence and, while it has a low mortality rate, the total number of mortalities is close to that of melanoma due to its high prev- alence [3]. The incidence of both BCC and SCC have stead- ily increased [4]. This is thought to be due, at least in part, to the cumulative exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, which is associated with 90% of NMSC cases [5]. Surgical resection utilizing peripheral and deep margin assessment (PDEMA) which includes Mohs surgery and surgical excision using standard vertical sectioning remain the mainstay of treatment for the majority of cases amenable to resection [6]. For cases not amenable to surgical resec- tion, cytotoxic chemotherapy had historically been utilized. Studies looking at outcomes for patients with advanced or metastatic BCC or CSSC were limited to case series, small sample sizes, and lack of randomization, but had limited convincing efficacy prior to the advent or targeted molecular therapies and immunotherapy [7]. In 2011, the first check- point inhibitor, ipilimumab, was approved for use in meta- static melanoma followed by approval of pembrolizumab [8]. Since then, immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer therapy, expanding not only into other non-melanoma skin cancers but across solid tumors. The growth of immunother- apy and targeted molecular therapy in treatment of locally advanced and metastatic NMSC has significantly changed treatment options currently available to patients and there- fore survival in this population. This review summarizes sys- temic therapies currently available for treatment of locally advanced and metastatic non-melanoma skin cancers and highlights emerging therapies under investigation. Spencer Lessans and Katie A. O’Connell are the co-first authors. * Jennifer Choe jennifer.choe@vumc.org 1 Department of Internal Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA 2 Department of Dermatology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA 3 Department of Hematology/Oncology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Preston Research Building 790, 2220 Pierce Ave, Nashville, TN 37232, USA

1121 Current Oncology Reports (2024) 26:1120–1133 Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma CSCC is the second most common skin cancer behind BCC. Previous efforts to characterize the genetic land- scape of CSCC have proven difficult given high back- ground mutation rates as a result of ultraviolet damage [9]. UV radiation-induced mutations in TP53 play an important role early in the pathogenesis of CSCC. Muta- tions in NOTCH1, NOTCH2, CDKN21, HRAS, and FAT1 are also common, while mutations in KMT2C have been associated with poor outcomes and increased bone inva- sion. Additionally, CSCC displays one of the highest tumor mutational burden (TMB) among all solid tumors and high TMB is associated with increased response to immunotherapy [10]. Advanced CSCC includes both locally advanced CSCC (laCSCC) not amenable to surgery or radiotherapy and metastatic CSCC (mCSCC). For advanced CSCC where a cure is unlikely following surgery or radiotherapy, pri- mary treatment options defined by NCCN CSCC Guide- lines Version 1.2024 include neoadjuvant cemiplimab after multidisciplinary discussion and surgical resection utilizing PDEMA or standard excision with wider surgical margins and postoperative margin assessment. For non- surgical candidates, standard of care includes radiotherapy in combination with systemic therapy or systemic therapy alone if curative radiotherapy is not feasible. Guidelines suggest considering neoadjuvant cemiplimab for rapidly growing tumors, in-transit metastasis, lymphovascular invasion, borderline resectability, or if surgery alone may not be curative or may result in significant functional limi- tations. Preferred systemic regimens include cemiplimab, pembrolizumab, or a clinical trial. In patients who are ineligible for or have progressed on immunotherapy and clinical trials, carboplatin, paclitaxel, and cetuximab may be considered [11]. Chemotherapy and Targeted Therapy Prior to immunotherapy, both targeted therapy and chem- otherapy were used for advanced CSCC with generally poor responses. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors as monotherapy have been associated with an objective response rate (ORR) of 10–31% [12–15]. Data on chemotherapy are limited to retrospective studies or prospective studies with small sample sizes. Although immunotherapy has dramatically changed outcomes for patients, treatment in those with immunotherapy-refrac- tory or ineligible disease still primarily relies upon chemo- therapy and/or targeted therapy. In a recent retrospective analysis of patients treated with cetuximab, among 11 patients who were given cetuximab following immuno- therapy failure, the ORR was 64% with quick and durable responses, suggesting cetuximab should be considered as the preferred therapy following immunotherapy failure [16]. Immunotherapy Cemiplimab Cemiplimab is a monoclonal antibody directed against pro- grammed death 1 (PD-1). In September 2018, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved cemiplimab for treat- ment of mCSCC or laCSCC in patients who are not candi- dates for curative surgery or radiation [17]. This marked the first time that the FDA officially approved any systemic therapy for advanced CSCC, for which no standard-of- care existed. Approval was based on a phase I study which included patients with laCSCC and mCSCC as well as a phase II study of patients with mCSCC. In the phase I study, the ORR was 50% while the phase II study reported an ORR of 47% with 4 complete responses (CR) at median follow-up of 7.9 months. Notable adverse events (AE) were cellulitis, pneumonitis, hypercalcemia, pleural effusion, and death [18]. In another study of 78 patients with laCSCC given cemiplimab, the ORR was 44% where 10 patients achieved CR at median follow up of 9.3 months [19]. Another clini- cal trial investigated fixed-dose cemiplimab compared to weight-based dosing and found an ORR of 45.2% where patients with fixed-dose cemiplimab achieved comparable results to weight-based dosing (ORR

Another clini- cal trial investigated fixed-dose cemiplimab compared to weight-based dosing and found an ORR of 45.2% where patients with fixed-dose cemiplimab achieved comparable results to weight-based dosing (ORR of 41.1% vs 49.2%) [20]. EMPOWER-CSCC 1 was the largest pooled dataset of patients with advanced CSCC treated with cemiplimab and reported an ORR of 46.1% at median follow-up of 15.7 months. Additionally, improved CR were observed over time given increased CR in this study as compared with primary analyses as above. Among the 31 complete responders, median time to CR was 11.2 months [21]. Pembrolizumab Pembrolizumab is another monoclonal antibody target- ing PD-1 that became the second immunotherapy agent approved for CSCC in June 2020 for patients with recur- rent or mCSCC not curable by surgery or radiation [22]. Later, FDA approval was expanded to include patients with laCSCC not curable by surgery or radiation. Initial approval was based upon data from KEYNOTE-629, a phase II non-randomized study of patients with recurrent or mCSCC. This study also included a cohort of patients with laCSCC. Among patients with recurrent or meta- static disease, the ORR was 35.2%. Among those who responded, 10.5% achieved CR. For patients with laCSCC,

1122 Current Oncology Reports (2024) 26:1120–1133 the ORR was 50% with 16.7% achieving CR [23]. 69.2% of patients experienced one or more treatment-related AEs. 14 patients discontinued therapy due to AEs and 2 patients died from fatal AEs. CASKIN was another phase II study of pembroli- zumab for advanced CSCC with an ORR of 42% with 4 patients achieving CR and median overall survival was 25.3 months [24]. The I-TACKLE trial (NCT03666325) is a nonrand- omized phase 2 trial for patients with laCSCC and mCSCC with pembrolizumab. If patients achieve either a PR or CR, they continued on pembrolizumab. However, in the case of stable disease or disease progression, patients received both pembrolizumab and cetuximab. Thus far, 43 patients have been enrolled and 23 underwent combination treat- ment (17 PD and 6 SD). 21 patients were noted to have pri- mary resistance and 2 had acquired resistance. Cumulative ORR was 63% with 44% responding to pembrolizumab alone and 38% responding to combination therapy given primary resistance. In the 2 patients with acquired resist- ance, both achieved PR following combination therapy. Therefore, a total of 44% of patients responded to combi- nation therapy. Combination therapy resulted in one-year PFS of 42% while monotherapy had 51%. Grade ≥ 3 AEs occurred in 35% of patients on combination therapy and 16% of patients on pembrolizumab alone with 3 patients on monotherapy discontinuing treatment secondary to AEs [25]. Nivolumab Nivolumab is another PD-1 inhibitor being studied for patients with advanced CSCC. A single-arm phase 2 study of nivolumab for systemic treatment-naïve patients with advanced CSCC included 24 patients (4 locally advanced, 16 locoregional, 4 metastatic). Best objective response rate of 58.3% was reported at 24 weeks (0 CR, 14 PR). The incidence of grade 3 or higher immune related adverse events (irAEs) was 25% and only one patient discontinued therapy due to toxicity [26]. Another multicenter, single-arm phase 2 study (NIVOSQUACS) reported impressive results in patients with laCSCC or mCSCC given nivolumab for up to 24 months. Notably, patients with concomitant hematologi- cal malignancies (non-progressing or stable under active therapy) were eligible for inclusion and 35% of patients had a coexisting hematological malignancy. The ORR was 61.3% and 22.6% of patients achieved an investigator- assessed complete response. The incidence of grade ≥ 3 irAEs was 19.4% and two patients discontinued nivolumab due to irAEs [27]. Neoadjuvant Use Neoadjuvant use of cemiplimab has been studied in a phase 2 trial with ORR of 68% in patients with stage II-IV (M0) CSSC and CR in 51%, demonstrating high therapeutic activity in patients with resectable disease [28]. Neoadju- vant therapy allowed for decreased surgical morbidity with preservation of important functional structures. Although not FDA approved since pathologic response rates are not considered a validated endpoint by the FDA, neoadjuvant cemiplimab has become commonplace due to its impres- sive response rates. It remains unknown if the pathologic response rate translates to improved survival outcomes to support its use as an appropriate surrogate. Despite a lack of long-term outcomes, neoadjuvant cemiplimab has been practice-changing given the potential for reduced surgical morbidity. Since half of all patients develop a complete pathologic response with neoadjuvant cemiplimab, this has resulted in questions about how to best manage sites of disease that are no longer clinically evident and whether definitive interventions of surgery or radiation are necessary. A phase 3 trial evaluating neoadjuvant cemiplimab with sur- vival outcomes is currently under development to determine whether pathologic or clinical response translates to long- term overall survival or progression-free survival benefit. Several neoadjuvant trials are currently underway assess- ing use of cemiplimab, pembrolizumab, nivolumab, and nivolumab with ipilimumab

or clinical response translates to long- term overall survival or progression-free survival benefit. Several neoadjuvant trials are currently underway assess- ing use of cemiplimab, pembrolizumab, nivolumab, and nivolumab with ipilimumab for patients with resectable CSCC (Table 1). Case series have reported success with neo- adjuvant pembrolizumab in patients with advanced CSCC [29, 30]. Additionally, a trial involving neoadjuvant use of a co-formulated LAG3 inhibitor (favezelimab) plus pem- brolizumab (MK-4280A) vs pembrolizumab monotherapy is ongoing (NCT06036836). Neoadjuvant atezolizumab, cetuximab, and erlotinib are also being investigated. Adjuvant Use Two trials designed to evaluate adjuvant pembrolizumab (NCT03833167) and cemiplimab (NCT03969004) are underway. In addition, several of the neoadjuvant trials mentioned above include adjuvant use as well. Based on the study designs, it is unclear whether adjuvant therapy is necessary if neoadjuvant therapy is given. Emerging Therapies Although survival has improved following approval of immunotherapy, there are many patients with advanced CSCC who do not respond or develop resistance [31–33]. A number of strategies for overcoming immunotherapy

NCT06041802 is a trial studying MK-3475A, combination pembrolizumab and MK-5180, a small molecule inhibitor against aurora-A kinase [37]. NCT03082534 is investigating pembrolizumab with cetuxi- mab for HNSCC with preliminary data showing an ORR of 45% at 6 months, exceeding published response rates for pembrolizumab or cetuximab monotherapy in this cohort [34]. NCT05269381 is a phase 1 trial investigating a vac- cine targeting neoantigens on tumor cells in combination with pembrolizumab. AURELIO-04 (NCT05256381) is a trial studying SOT101, a subcutaneous IL-15Rβγ agonist in combination with pembrolizumab after phase 1 prelimi- nary data (NCT04234113) showed encouraging results. NCT04389632 is a trial assessing SGN-B6A, an integrin beta-6-targeted antibody–drug conjugate as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab. NCT04812535 is studying vilobelimab (IFX-1), a monoclonal anti-C5a antibody, alone and in combination with pembrolizumab. Vilobelimab has previously been studied in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock given C5a’s role in comple- ment activation [38]. NCT04429542 is studying BCA101, a tumor-targeted bifunctional fusion antibody that simulta- neously inhibits EGFR and TGFβ signaling as monother- apy and in combination with pembrolizumab. ABILITY-1 (NCT05086692) is evaluating MDNA11 (long-acting "beta- only" recombinant IL-2) alone and in combination with pembrolizumab. NCT04576091 is investigating combina- tion therapy with elimusertib, a selective oral inhibitor of the Ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related kinase, stereotactic body radiation, and pembrolizumab for HNSCC. Cosibelimab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to PD-L1 with a functional domain capable of inducing anti- body-dependent and complement-dependent cytotoxicity against tumor cells [39]. An ORR of 47.4% was reported with a median time to response of 1.9 months and median follow-up of 15.4 months and lower rates of irAEs [39]. Only 23.1% of participants experienced irAEs with 2.5% experiencing grade 3 AEs. In July 2023, long-term data was reported with ORR of 55% for laCSCC (23% CR, 32% PR) and 50% for mCSCC (13% CR, 37% PR) [40]. Given positive results, an application was submitted to the FDA in January 2023 for approval of Cosibelimab for patients with advanced CSCC, however as of December 2023 the medica- tion is not yet approved [41]. The trial arm of NIVOSQUACS (NCT04204837) studying nivolumab combination therapy with relatli- mab is ongoing [27]. Relatlimab is a lymphocyte acti- vation gene-3 inhibitor and combination nivolumab- relatlimab is being studied for HNSCC (NCT04326257). Atezolizumab, a monoclonal antibody against PD-L1, is being investigated as combination therapy for CSCC in several ongoing trials: NCT05085496 ( with radiotherapy), NCT03108131 (with cobimetinib), and NCT03901573 (with NT-17[efineptakin alfa], a long-acting IL-7 agonist). Carrilizumab and camrelizumab are PD-1 inhibitors being studied in combination with chemotherapy: carrili- zumab with paclitaxel (NCT05886140) and camrelizumab with cisplatin. NCT03944941 is a trial studying avelumab (a PD-L1 inhibitor) monotherapy and in combination with cetuximab. NCT03775525 is a trial of oral GZ17-6.02 (a combination of isovanillin, curcumin, and harmine) mono- therapy and in combination with capecitabine. Afatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor being studied for advanced CSCC (NCT05070403). Several trials are evaluating oral PD-L1 inhibitors for CSCC (NCT04242199, NCT05888844, NCT04272034).

assessed with preliminary results demonstrating an ORR of 23.8% at 9.6 months and 62.5% at 3.1 months depending on dosage [42]. Talimogene laherparepvec (TVEC) is an oncolytic viral therapy that is FDA approved for advanced melanoma. It has shown success for CSCC and has been explored in sev- eral clinical trials (NCT03714828, NCT03458117). T-VEC is also being explored in combination with nivolumab (NCT02978625) for advanced CSCC. Oncolytic viruses have been shown to improve antitumor immune response via multiple mechanisms and are being increasingly stud- ied in clinical trials [43]. Beyond TVEC, a number of oncolytic viruses are currently being investigated both alone and in combination with anti-PD-1 therapies. The CERPASS trial (NCT04050436) is investigating combi- nation cemiplimab and RP1, an oncolytic virus (HSV-1) that expresses a fusogenic glycoprotein and granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor. RP1 has shown success in combination with nivolumab for NMSC, including CSCC, in the IGNYTE trial (NCT03767348). NCT05859074 is evaluating MQ710, a multi-transgene expressing modified vaccinia virus, alone and in combina- tion with pembrolizumab. NCT04301011 is investigating intratumoral and intravenous TBio-6517 (an engineered vaccinia virus that expresses the Flt3 ligand, an antibody targeting CTLA4, and IL-12) alone and in combination with pembrolizumab. Intratumoral vidutolimod is a CpG-A TLR9 agonist that is currently being investigated in combination with cemi- plimab (NCT04916002). Finally, a trial assessing intra- tumoral TransCon TLR7/8 agonist, a sustained-release prodrug of resiquimod, alone and in combination with pembrolizumab is ongoing (NCT04799054).

1126 Current Oncology Reports (2024) 26:1120–1133 Basal Cell Carcinoma Basal cell carcinoma is the most common skin cancer with more than 3.6 million cases diagnosed annually [44]. It is highly correlated to UV exposure and skin type [1, 45, 46]. It is more common in older adults due to cumulative UV exposure but has been increasing in incidence for younger adults as well, which may be partially explained by arti- ficial UV sources [47]. The cause of basal cell carcinoma is complex and multifactorial, including genetics (such as mutations in the Hedgehog signaling pathway), phenotype (lighter skin color), and environment (UV exposure). For laBCC not amenable to curative intent local inter- vention, the current standard of care is initial treatment with a hedgehog inhibitor (HHI) (either vismodegib or sonidegib). For mBCC, vismodegib is the initial HHI of choice. Alternative dosing schedules or drug holidays can be used for intolerable side effects. For patients who were previously treated with a HHI or who cannot tolerate an HHI, cemiplimab is the standard second-line therapy. Hedgehog Inhibitors 70% of sporadic BCCs have PTCH1 (protein patched homolog 1) mutations, the receptor for Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) [48]. When Shh binds PTCH1, smoothened (SMO), an associated protein suppressed by unbound PTCH1, loses this inhibition and becomes activated, leading to cell proliferation [49]. Inactivating mutations in PTCH1 or activating mutations in SMO are both commonly found in BCC. Indeed, inherited mutations in PTCH1 lead to Gor- lin Syndrome (nevoid basal-cell carcinoma syndrome), a condition associated with development of multiple BCCs, particularly at a young age [50]. Attempts to target the PTCH1/Shh/SMO pathway led to the development of Hedgehog pathway inhibitors [51]. Vismodegib was the first oral SMO inhibitor developed to target this pathway. It was FDA approved in January 2012 for treatment of locally advanced (laBCC) or meta- static BCC (mBCC) based on results of the ERIVANCE BCC trial [52]. In this trial, ORR was 30% in patients with mBCC and 43% in patients with laBCC. The median progression free survival (PFS) for mBCC was 9.2 months and 9.5 months for laBCC. 25% of patients developed grade III-IV adverse effects, with muscle spasms, alope- cia, weight loss, and dysgeusia being the most common. Meta-analyses have found similar results with an average ORR of 64.7% for laBCC and 33.6% for mBCC. Patients were on vismodegib for an average of 35.8 weeks [53]. In this analysis, 28.2% of patients discontinued vismodegib due to adverse effects, with muscle spasms, dysgeusia, and alopecia being the most common effects noted. Due to the durable effects of vismodegib in cases where surgical resection was not amenable, vismodegib was stud- ied in the neoadjuvant setting in patients with laBCC with the goal of tumor shrinkage prior to surgical resection. Large tumor size may render certain patients inoperable or have significant morbidities associated with resection such as functional deficits or disfiguration. In the VISMONEO trial, 80% of patients with locally advanced BCC who received neoadjuvant vismodegib achieved downstaging of surgical resection after a mean treatment duration of 6 months [54]. 36% of patients had known recurrence at 3 years of follow- up. There was a 20% incidence of grade III-IV adverse effects. Neoadjuvant use of vismodegib has also been stud- ied in the use of periocular laBCC where it had an ORR of 75% and reduced rates of orbital exenteration (surgical removal of the eyeball and surrounding tissues) from 46 to 6% [55, 56]. Sonidegib is another oral SMO inhibitor that is currently approved for laBCC. In the BOLT trial, the ORR (while on 200mg) for mBCC was 8% and 56% for laBCC. Median PFS was 13.1 months for mBCC and 22.1 months for laBCC. There was a 43% incidence of grade 3–4 adverse effects with a side effect profile comparable to vismodegib. There have been no head-to-head trials comparing vismodegib

and 22.1 months for laBCC. There was a 43% incidence of grade 3–4 adverse effects with a side effect profile comparable to vismodegib. There have been no head-to-head trials comparing vismodegib to sonidegib [57]. In an indirect comparison, sonidegib had a higher ORR and PFS compared to vismodegib with slightly lower rates of adverse effects [58, 59]. Adverse effects are a limiting factor in the long-term tolerability of HHIs for patients. In addition, these adverse effects are class-specific, meaning that sonidegib and vis- modegib will be tolerated similarly for a specific patient and switching agents due to adverse effects will likely not lead to better tolerability [60]. As a result, altering the drug-regimen schedule in response to adverse effects has become proto- colized with similar efficacy as seen in the original clinical trials [61, 62]. Tadadegib is a new HHI currently under investigation. Phase I data showed an appropriate safety profile and clini- cal response but there are not currently any active phase II trials [63]. Clinical trials of topical hedgehog inhibitors (patidegib) in order to minimize systemic absorption and adverse effects are currently under investigation [64]. Inter- estingly, itraconazole, an antifungal medication, is a strong antagonist of the Hedgehog inhibitor pathway, in a mecha- nism different from oral SMO inhibitors, and is also being studied in the treatment of BCC [65]. Patients on HHIs can develop resistance during treat- ment, leading to refractory disease. Analyses have shown that most cases of HHI resistance are due to mutations of SMO that lead to alterations in how the drug accesses its binding site or mutations in the binding site itself. There are

1127 Current Oncology Reports (2024) 26:1120–1133 also downstream targets that have been found to have muta- tions, conferring resistance [66, 67]. Immunotherapy Cemiplimab was approved in February 2021 for treat- ment of laBCC in patients who already progressed through or were intolerant to HHIs. In long-term follow-up of NCT03132636, there was an ORR of 32.1% with a median PFS of 15.6 months. 48% of patients suffered grade III-IV adverse events [68, 69]. There have been case series of other immunotherapy agents, such as pembrolizumab, given with and without oral SMO agents with similar effectiveness (44% ORR for pembrolizumab alone and 29% for combina- tion therapy) [70]. Merkel Cell Carcinoma Merkel cell carcinoma is a rare and aggressive skin cancer that has neuroendocrine features. It is neuroendocrine in ori- gin due to immunohistochemistry revealing chromogranin A, synaptophysin, and CD56, as well as somatostatin recep- tors [71, 72]. Despite the tumor cell’s resemblance to Merkel cells which are mechanoreceptors in the dermis of the skin, it is currently believed that MCC does not arise from Merkel cells and the true origin has yet to be elucidated [73]. 80% of cases of MCC are thought to be due to the Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV) and cases not associated with MCV are thought to be due to DNA damage from UV radiation [74, 75]. For mMCC, standard therapy includes anti PD-1 therapy (avelumab, pembrolizumab, nivolumab, or retifanlimab). Avelumab or pembrolizumab are most used due to their prevalence. Cytotoxic Chemotherapy Before the advent of immunotherapy, cytotoxic chemo- therapy was used as first-line for patients with metastatic MCC (mMCC). While multiple different regimens were used, the most common were etoposide with either carbopl- atin or cisplatin [76]. 55% of patients responded to first-line chemotherapy and 23% of patients responded to second-line therapy with a median overall survival of 9.5 months from the start of chemotherapy. Cytotoxic chemotherapy is still used for patients who have progressed through or who cannot tolerate immuno- therapy and is also used for palliative debulking and sympto- matic management [77]. There have been studies investigat- ing if adjuvant use of systemic chemotherapy after surgery or radiation improves survival and, so far, no survival benefit has been seen [78, 79]. Immunotherapy PD-L1 expression was found in the MCC microenvironment in 49% of tumor cells, making it a possible target in the treat- ment of mMCC [80]. Avelumab (PD-L1 inhibitor) became the first FDA-approved agent for the treatment of mMCC in 2017 [81]. Evidence for this use came out of the results of the JAVELIN Merkel 200 trial which showed ORR of 33% and median PFS of 2.7 months in patients with mMCC who had progressed on cytotoxic chemotherapy [82, 83]. Only 10% of patients had grade III-IV adverse effects. There was a trend towards a lower ORR for patients with MCV- positive versus MCV-negative tumors (26% versus 46%) but the results were not statistically significant. In comparison, patients with mMCC who were chemotherapy-naïve were shown to have a higher ORR (56.3% versus 33%) [84]. Pembrolizumab was approved for mMCC in 2018. In the KEYNOTE-017 trial, patients with mMCC who were chemotherapy-naïve had an ORR of 56% with a median PFS of 16.8 months [85]. The response rate was higher among those with MCV-positive tumors than those with MCV-neg- ative tumors (62% versus 44%). 28% of patients had grade III-IV adverse effects. An extended analysis with a median follow-up of 31.8 months showed an overall response rate of 58% [86]. There have been no head-to-head comparisons of avelumab versus pembrolizumab. Retifanlimab is another PD-1 inhibitor approved for advanced or metastatic MCC. The POD1UM-201 trial showed an ORR of 46.2% among chemotherapy-naïve patients with 28.7% of patients having grade III-IV adverse effects [87].

showed an ORR of 46.2% among chemotherapy-naïve patients with 28.7% of patients having grade III-IV adverse effects [87]. Nivolumab has been studied in the neoadjuvant setting for MCC. In the CheckMate 358 trial, 47% of patients with resectable MCC who received neoadjuvant nivolumab achieved a pathologic complete response after surgery and 54.5% had tumor reduction of 30% or greater with a median follow-up of 26 weeks [88]. 7.7% of patients had grade III-IV adverse effects. Given the availability of durable responses both avelumab and pembrolizumab have shown and limited long-term data with retifanlimab or nivolumab, these two agents are not commonly used. Combination immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ipilimumab and nivolumab) have also been studied for advanced MCC. Patients who were immunotherapy-naïve had an ORR of 100% while patients who had been previously treated with immunotherapy had an overall response rate of 31%, with higher toxicity profiles than patients on single immunother- apy agents alone [89] In another study looking at combina- tion therapy for patients who progressed on single agents, 31% of patients experienced a grade III-IV immune-related adverse event with a median overall survival of 4.7 months from the initiation of combination therapy [90]. As a result of a high toxicity profile and conflicting data on whether or not combination therapy provides improved responses to

Adjuvant nivolumab has been studied after complete resection of MCC in the ADMEC-O trial. Nivolumab was found to have an absolute risk reduction of 10% of disease- free survival versus observation (84% versus 73%) with 42% of patients treated with nivolumab having grade 3–4 adverse events versus 11% of patients under observation [94]. Emerging Therapies Like other neuroendocrine tumors, MCC expresses soma- tostatin receptors, activation of which generally triggers inhibitory pathways downstream. The use of somatostatin analogues in the treatment of mMCC has been studied in case series with some success [95, 96]. Currently, there are clinical trials ongoing looking at the use of peptide receptor radionuclide therapy in combination with immunotherapy for mMCC, which has already shown success in small case series [97, 98]. T-VEC has shown some success in case reports when used for advanced MCC [99, 100]. It is currently being investigated in clinical trials [101]. Many other clinical trials are ongoing. The MERCURY trial is looking at neoadjuvant retifanlimab plus platinum- etoposide therapy for resectable MCC (NCT05594290) [102]. The I-MAT trial is a phase II trial investigating adju- vant avelumab in stage I-III MCC (NCT04291885) [103] The ADAM trial is a phase III trial investigating adjuvant avelumab in stage III MCC (NCT03271372) [104]. The KEYNOTE-913 trial is a phase III study looking at pem- brolizumab in untreated advanced MCC (NCT03783078) [105]. The MERKLIN2 trial is a phase II study investigat- ing domatinostat, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, in com- bination with avelumab in patients with advanced or meta- static MCC who have progressed on anti-PD-L1 therapy (NCT04393753) [106]. NCT03787602 is a study investigat- ing KRT-232, a MDM2 inhibitor, for MCC in patients who failed treatment with anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy [107]. Transplant Patients Immunocompromised patients have a higher risk of develop- ing CSCC with studies suggesting poorer outcomes [108]. It has been shown that cost of skin-cancer related dermatologi- cal care for transplant recipients is higher when compared with non-immunosuppressed patients, which is primarily driven by CSCCs in transplant patients requiring advanced and/or multimodal treatment regimens [109]. Among solid organ transplant recipients (SOTRs), risk of rejection is notable with one study reporting it to be as high as 37% [108]. Several clinical trials are exploring safety and efficacy of immunotherapy for SOTR with advanced skin cancer. CONTRAC-1 (NCT04339062) reported results of a phase I study of cemiplimab for renal transplant recipients with advanced CSCC [110]. Twelve patients received cemi- plimab with a standardized approach to immunosuppression with mTOR inhibition and dynamic prednisone. Of 11 evalu- able patients, 5 responded at median follow-up of 6.8 months (3 CR and 2 PR), no patients experienced rejection or graft loss [111]. Two patient had stable disease. One patient died of angioedema and anaphylaxis which was attributed to the mTOR inhibitor [110]. NCT03816332 is a phase I/II trial assessing combination nivolumab plus tacrolimus plus prednisone ± ipilimumab in renal transplant patients with advanced skin cancers, including 5 patients with CSCC and 2 with MCC [112]. All patients had progressive disease with nivolumab + tacrolimus + prednisone. For those with CSCC, 3 patients received nivolumab + tacrolimus + pred- nisone + ipilimumab resulting in 2 CR and 1 stable dis- ease. One of the patients with CR experienced treatment- related allograft loss 6 weeks after starting nivolumab. Both patients with MCC were subsequently treated with addition of ipilimumab however both had progressive disease and one experienced allograft loss 8 weeks after discontinua- tion of therapy [112]. Thus,

Both patients with MCC were subsequently treated with addition of ipilimumab however both had progressive disease and one experienced allograft loss 8 weeks after discontinua- tion of therapy [112]. Thus, the risk of rejection must be clearly discussed with transplant patients being considered for immunotherapy and patients should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis pending future studies. Immunosuppres- sion with mTOR inhibition and a pulsed steroid approach for transplant patients on immunotherapy may be considered. Conclusion In this review, we examined the latest advances of systemic therapies for advanced and metastatic non-melanoma skin cancers. Understanding the pathophysiology and molecular background of NMSC has become increasingly essential as more and more targeted therapies are being developed and studied. Immunotherapy has greatly expanded treatment options across all types of NMSC and its use in both neoad- juvant and adjuvant settings are actively being investigated. As the incidence of non-melanoma skin cancer continues to rise, clinicians should feel better equipped to treat advanced and metastatic NMSC.

PRACTICAL APPROACH Recognising Skin Cancer in Primary Care Owain T. Jones . Charindu K. I. Ranmuthu . Per N. Hall . Garth Funston . Fiona M. Walter Received: September 3, 2019 / Published online: November 16, 2019  The Author(s) 2019 ABSTRACT Skin cancer, including melanoma, basal cell carcinoma and cutaneous squamous cell carci- noma, has one of the highest global incidences of any form of cancer. In 2016 more than 16,000 people were diagnosed with melanoma in the UK. Over the last decade the incidence of melanoma has increased by 50% in the UK, and about one in ten melanomas are diagnosed at a late stage. Among the keratinocyte carcinomas (previously known as non-melanoma skin can- cers), basal cell carcinoma is the most common cancer amongst Caucasian populations. The main risk factor for all skin cancer is exposure to ultraviolet radiation—more than 80% are considered preventable. Primary care clinicians have a vital role to play in detecting and managing patients with skin lesions suspected to be skin cancer, as timely diagnosis and treatment can improve patient outcomes, par- ticularly for melanoma. However, detecting skin cancer can be challenging, as common non-malignant skin lesions such as seborrhoeic keratoses share features with less common skin cancers. Given that more than 80% of skin cancers are attributed to ultraviolet (UV) expo- sure, primary care clinicians can also play an important role in skin cancer prevention. This article is one of a series discussing cancer pre- vention and detection in primary care. Here we focus on the most common types of skin cancer: melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma. We describe the main risk fac- tors and prevention advice. We summarise key guidance on the symptoms and signs of skin cancers and their management, including their initial assessment and referral. In addition, we review emerging technologies and diagnostic aids which may become available for use in primary care in the near future, to aid the triage of suspicious skin lesions.

Key Summary Points Skin cancer, including melanoma and keratinocyte carcinomas (basal cell carcinoma and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma), has one of the highest global incidences of any form of cancer. Incidence rates of these types of skin cancer are increasing. Primary care clinicians have a vital role to play in detecting and managing patients with skin lesions suspected to be cancer; timely diagnosis and treatment can improve patient outcomes, particularly for melanoma. However, detecting skin cancers can be challenging. 80% of skin cancers are considered preventable, primarily through reduction in exposure to the main risk factor, UV radiation. Primary care clinicians can play an important role in skin cancer prevention through tailored advice about the risks of UV exposure. This article focusses on the most common types of skin cancer: melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma. We describe the main risk factors and prevention advice. We summarise key guidance on the symptoms and signs of skin cancers and their management, including their initial assessment and referral. In addition, we review emerging technologies and diagnostic aids, which at present require more evidence for their safety and efﬁcacy, but may become available for use in primary care in the near future, to aid the triage of suspicious skin lesions. BACKGROUND Skin cancer, including melanoma, basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), has one of the highest global incidences of any form of cancer [1]. Melanoma is the ﬁfth most common cancer in the UK, with around 16,000 patients diagnosed in 2016. If melanoma is diagnosed at an early stage, 5-year survival can be up to 95%, making early detection and treatment key to improving sur- vival. However, melanoma is prone to metas- tasise, making it responsible for up to 90% of skin cancer deaths (2285 deaths in 2016 in the UK) [2, 3]. Furthermore, among Caucasian populations in the UK, the incidence of mela- noma has quadrupled over the last 30 years, and is expected to be among the cancers with the fastest increasing incidence over the next 20 years, rising by a further 7% [4]. The ‘non-melanoma skin cancers’ (NMSC) include SCC and BCC, although they arise from keratinocyte cells and are increasingly known as keratinocyte carcinomas (KCs) [5]. They are very common. In the UK in 2015, more than 142,000 new cases were diagnosed, including about 80% BCC and 20% SCC [6, 7]. Similar to melanoma, the incidence of KCs has risen over recent dec- ades, with an increase of 61% over the past 10 years alone [6]. In the UK, most patients with skin cancer ﬁrst present in primary care [8], where clinicians then face the challenge of distinguishing a rare possible skin cancer from common benign skin lesions [9]. The National Cancer Diagnosis Audit in England recently reported that the median primary care interval (time from ﬁrst presentation to referral) for melanoma was 0 days, the joint lowest of the 21 cancers reported [10]. Prolonged intervals of 60 and 90 days were experienced by 6% and 4.8% cases respectively [10], suggesting that primary care clinicians are generally accurate at recognising suspicious skin lesions. However, among patients referred with suspicious skin lesions via an urgent suspected cancer ‘2-week-wait’ (2WW) system in England, only around 3% are diagnosed with melanoma [11], suggesting that improved primary care triage could reduce burden on both patients and specialist care. Although this article principally aims to support primary care clinicians in the UK to recognise and manage patients with possible skin cancer in a timely way, it will also be of relevance to clinicians in other healthcare systems.

focused on the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines, developed for use in England and Wales, to direct the discussion. We present melanoma and the ker- atinocyte carcinomas separately, except when their assessment and management can be con- sidered together. This article is based on previously conducted studies and does not involve any new studies of human or animal subjects performed by any of the authors. RISK FACTORS Skin cancer incidence relates strongly to age, with age-speciﬁc incidence rates rising sharply from 50 years to peak in those over 75 years of age. In contrast to most other cancers, 25% of melanomas are diagnosed in those aged 50 and under [12]. The main risk factor for all skin cancers is preventable, namely exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, with more than 80% of melanomas attributed to UV exposure [13, 14]. This includes not only long-term exposure but also short periods of intense sun exposure or burning, especially in childhood or with sunbed use. For SCCs, cumulative UV exposure appears to be the main risk factor, whereas intermittent UV exposure is the leading risk factor for BCCs [15]. Other risk factors for melanoma and KCs are listed in Fig. 1 [12, 16–21]. PREVENTION Prevention of skin cancer focuses on patient education about the risks and beneﬁts of sun exposure, and tailoring advice to the individual patient risk [22, 23]. Figure 2 provides a sum- mary of advice on avoiding sun exposure [22–25]. A systematic review exploring complex risk communication, undertaken to support NICE guidelines on sunlight exposure [22], found that only tailored messages (i.e. person- alised to individual circumstances) had strong evidence as a potentially effective strategy for improving health behaviour outcomes. Relative risk reduction (i.e. the relative decrease in the risk of an adverse event in the group adhering to preventative advice compared to the group not following preventative advice) was thought to be more persuasive in getting people to adopt certain behaviours than other statistical pre- sentations. There is evidence that interventions based on the appearance-damaging effects of UV exposure, and the positive effects of sun protection, may be effective in altering beha- viour [26]. Cancer Research UK have produced numerous patient information resources as part of their Sun Smart campaign [27], which can be Fig. 1 Risk factors for melanoma and KCs Adv Ther (2020) 37:603–616 605

used by clinicians to aid communication with patients. SCREENING There is no evidence worldwide to support the use of screening programs at a population level [28, 29], although there is recent research interest in using risk assessment models to identify people at higher risk of melanoma, for personalised approaches to surveillance [30–32]. Guidelines in the USA recommend screening for patients at high risk of melanoma due to a strong family or personal history of skin cancer [33], and the Royal Australian College of Gen- eral Practitioners’ guidance suggests a 6-monthly full-skin examination for patients at high risk of melanoma and annually for those at high risk of KC [25]. Interestingly, a recent sys- tematic review assessing BCC screening against the World Health Organisation screening crite- ria [34] concluded that it may be beneﬁcial for lesions on the face. DETECTING SKIN CANCER IN PRIMARY CARE Melanoma Symptoms and Signs The commonest subtype of melanoma is known as superﬁcial spreading melanoma: this classically presents as a pigmented skin lesion (‘mole’) that has changed in size, shape or colour [35] (Fig. 3). It most commonly presents on the trunk in men and on the legs in women [12]. Other mela- noma subtypes include nodular melanoma (5%), lentigo maligna (melanoma in situ, 4–15%), and acral lentiginous melanoma (5%) [36, 37] and these may present in different ways. Nodular melanomas tend to occur on the head and neck of older people: they grow quickly, and are usually ﬁrm, symmetrical and evenly pigmented papules or nodules, which may ulcerate and bleed. Lentigo maligna (also known as Hutchinson’s freckle) develop as a slow-growing precursor pigmented macule which may remain in situ for many years. Once it becomes invasive it is known as lentigo maligna melanoma and may progress rapidly, often being poorly deﬁned and variably pigmented; they are much more com- mon in people aged 60 and over. Acral lentiginous melanomas occur exclusively on the palms and soles and under nails, and are thought to be unrelated to sun exposure. Although uncommon among Caucasians, they are commoner in people with pigmented or Asian skin. They typically appear as a large pigmented macule, but can mimic warts with a verrucous, non-pigmented appearance [38–40]. An estimated 2–20% of melanomas are amelanotic—these can appear as a non-pig- mented mimic of any subtype, with nodular melanomas the most likely to be amelanotic [38]. They are more common in older age groups over 70 years of age and in the head and Fig. 2 Advice to give patients aiming to reduce sun exposure and risk of skin cancer [22–25] 606 Adv Ther (2020) 37:603–616

neck region, and tend to have worse outcomes than pigmented melanomas [38]. Management NICE guidance (2015) recommends using naked eye examination and the weighted Glasgow 7-point checklist to assess suspicious skin lesions (see Fig. 4; [24, 41, 42]). If a lesion scores 3 or more, then referral via an urgent suspected cancer pathway is recommended [41]. There are a number of other checklists available, such as the ‘‘ABCDE’’ mnemonic, most commonly used in North America, which refers to Asymmetry, Border irregularity, Colour variation, Diameter larger than 6 mm, Evolution/changing [43, 44].

should not be excised in primary care [45], although a recent study suggests that no harm came to patients undergoing primary care excision in the rural Scottish setting [46]. To avoid missing atypical melanomas, the NICE clinical knowledge summary also recommends referring the following lesions via an urgent suspected cancer pathway: new nodules which are pigmented or vascular in appearance; nail change such as a new pigmented line or pigmentation under the nail; or any skin lesion that is persistent or slowly evolving and unre- sponsive, with an uncertain diagnosis [24]. A routine referral for risk estimation, educa- tion and possible surveillance should be con- sidered for anyone who is potentially at high risk for developing melanoma. This includes those who have giant congenital pigmented naevi (benign melanocytic naevi originating in utero measuring greater than 20 cm in diameter Fig. 4 a Weighted Glasgow 7-point checklist for assessing suspicious pigmented skin lesions, as recommend by NICE guidance (2015) [41, 42]. b Reassuring clinical features that do not require referral to secondary care (unless there are other concerning symptoms) as they suggest a benign lesion [24] 608 Adv Ther (2020) 37:603–616

[47]), a family history of three or more mela- noma cases, more than 100 normal moles, or any atypical moles (particularly if multiple) [24]. Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) Symptoms and Signs SCCs tend to arise in areas that are frequently exposed to the sun: face, scalp, ears, neck, and upper limbs [48] (Fig. 5). Typically, they appear either as an indurated (ﬁrm), nodular, crusted lesion, or as an ulcer with no crusting [49, 50]. However, their appearance is variable and they should be suspected in any lesion that is larger than 1 cm, is non-healing, keratinized or crus- ted, and has a documented expansion over the past 8 weeks [51]. In situ SCC (Bowen’s disease) typically appear as erythematous, scaly plaques with clearly deﬁned margins, but can some- times be pigmented and ﬂat with poorly deﬁned margins [19]. A variant of SCC is keratoacan- thoma; these are domed, fast-growing, nodules with a central hyperkeratotic region [52]. High- risk SCCs include those on the lips, ears, non- sun-exposed sites, in areas of previous injury, those that are larger than 2 cm in diameter, are in immunocompromised patients, or are a recurrence of a previously treated lesion. These have a higher probability of metastasis and recurrence after treatment [45]. Management As for melanoma, conﬁrmation of an SCC relies on excision and histopathological examination; therefore all patients with a suspicious lesion should be referred on an urgent suspected can- cer pathway to secondary care [41]. bFig. 5 Clinical images of types of SCCs. a Well-differen- tiated SCC. b SCC on scalp. c Poorly differentiated SCC. d Keratoacanthoma.

Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) Symptoms and Signs BCCs commonly arise in the head, neck, trunk and limbs [20], but can be variable in their clinical presentations (Fig. 6). There are several histological subtypes [53] which may present differently. Nodular and micro-nodular BCCs are commonly found on the face and present as pearly pink or white cystic papules or nodules that have telangiectasia on their surface and may be ulcerated. Superﬁcial BCCs are usually on the upper trunk and shoulders, and present as erythematous, well-demarked, scaly plaques with pearly white borders. They are often large ([ 20 mm), multiple and slow growing, and can be confused with Bowen’s disease. Another important mimic is amelanotic melanoma, which can present as a red lesion and be con- fused with a BCC [54]. Morphoeic BCCs (also known as sclerosing or inﬁltrative) usually occur on the face and present as skin-coloured, waxy, scar-like lesions; they tend to recur and can inﬁltrate cutaneous nerves. Pigmented BCCs are brown, blue or greyish lesions that can resemble melanomas. Baso squamous BCCs have mixed BCC and SCC characteristics and can be more aggressive than other forms of BCC [53, 55, 56]. Management The 2010 NICE guidance recommends that low- risk BCCs (see Fig. 7) may be excised by primary care clinicians with appropriate training [53, 57]. This guidance may vary by local agreement, depending on the clinicians’ role, competencies and local policy. For all other patients with a suspected BCC, routine referral to specialist care is recommended, although, if there is concern that a delay in referral will make a ‘‘signiﬁcant impact’’ because of factors such as lesion site or size, then referral via an urgent cancer pathway should be considered [41].

surface reﬂection, and can help assessment of skin lesions with visualisation of deeper sub- surface structures [58]. Dermoscopy performed by trained specialists is both more sensitive and speciﬁc in classifying skin lesions than clinical examination with the naked eye alone [59, 60]. There have been two recent Cochrane reviews of the evidence for dermoscopy to diagnose keratinocyte carcinomas [61] and melanoma [62]. Both found that most evidence was derived from secondary care populations; hence, there was insufﬁcient evidence to sup- port routine use of dermoscopy by primary care clinicians. Our group’s recent systematic review of dermoscopy use in primary care also found the literature to be scanty; however, there was some evidence that dermoscopy has the potential to help primary care clinicians triage suspicious lesions [63]. It also highlighted that further evidence is needed on patient accept- ability and minimum training requirements for primary care clinicians to reach competence, as well as the cost-effectiveness of implementing dermoscopy in primary care. Teledermatology This term describes the use of information technology to facilitate skin management, most commonly by sharing digital images of lesions with dermatology specialists. Teledermatology referral systems are already well established in some areas of the UK. A recent Cochrane review assessing the diagnostic accuracy of telederma- tology for detecting melanomas, BCCs and SCCs in adults compared to face-to-face diag- nosis by a specialist concluded that telederma- tology is accurate for identifying the majority of malignant lesions [64]. However, it also sug- gested that further research is needed to fully determine its diagnostic accuracy, feasibility and cost-effectiveness as a triaging tool for referring suspicious skin lesions from primary to secondary care. SIAscopy/MoleMate System Spectrophotometric intracutaneous analysis (SIAscopy) is a non-invasive scanning technol- ogy, incorporated into the MoleMate system, and evaluated in a randomised controlled trial set in UK general practice. The MoleMate sys- tem was not found to improve appropriateness of referral, and its use led to a higher proportion of lesions being referred [65]. However, there was some evidence that a higher referral rate from general practice may actually be cost-ef- fective owing to improved outcomes associated with earlier diagnosis of melanomas [66]. Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI)-Supported Systems The use of AI/machine learning to evaluate skin lesions has received a huge amount of recent attention in both the lay and medical press. Experimental studies using images of lesions from specialist clinics have shown that AI algorithms can classify images of skin cancer with an accuracy that matches or even exceeds dermatologists [67, 68]. This suggests that AI has the potential to assist primary care clini- cians to triage suspicious skin lesions; research is now needed on real-world primary care pop- ulations to establish the accuracy and safety of using these AI technologies in primary care. Other Diagnostic Tools Many other non-invasive tests and diagnostic technologies have been developed to aid skin cancer diagnosis, including high frequency ultrasonography, optical coherence tomogra- phy, reﬂectance confocal microscopy, and computer-assisted diagnosis. They have been evaluated in several recent Cochrane reviews, all of which found a paucity of evidence for their accuracy in either primary or specialist care settings. Therefore, at present, there is insufﬁcient evidence to recommend their use [64, 69–73]. CONCLUSIONS Advice on limiting sun exposure remains an important task for primary care clinicians, especially among high-risk patient groups. Any suspected melanomas or SCCs should be refer- red via urgent cancer pathways to specialist care for histological diagnosis and management. Suspected BCCs should be referred routinely to specialist care unless they are of concern 612 Adv

because of their size or location, when they may warrant urgent referral. A number of diagnostic technologies are in development, some of which may have a sig- niﬁcant impact on clinical practice. We may therefore be on the verge of signiﬁcant changes in the detection of possible skin cancers in pri- mary care. However, the evidence for the safe and effective use of most of these technologies by primary care clinicians is currently lacking. There is weak evidence for use of dermoscopy and teledermatology in primary care, but even these approaches require further evaluation before they can be recommended for wide- spread implementation in primary care.

Becker1,2,3 · Andreas Stang4,5 · David Schrama6 · Selma Ugurel2 Accepted: 21 March 2024 / Published online: 22 April 2024 © The Author(s) 2024 Abstract Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare skin cancer characterized by neuroendocrine differentiation. Its carcinogenesis is based either on the integration of the Merkel cell polyomavirus or on ultraviolet (UV) mutagenesis, both of which lead to high immunogenicity either through the expression of viral proteins or neoantigens. Despite this immunogenicity resulting from viral or UV-associated carcinogenesis, it exhibits highly aggressive behavior. However, owing to the rarity of MCC and the lack of epidemiologic registries with detailed clinical data, there is some uncertainty regarding the spontaneous course of the disease. Historically, advanced MCC patients were treated with conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy yielding a median response duration of only 3 months. Starting in 2017, four programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death- ligand 1 (PD-L1) immune checkpoint inhibitors—avelumab, pembrolizumab, nivolumab (utilized in both neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings), and retifanlimab—have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with disseminated MCC on the basis of prospective clinical trials. However, generating clinical evidence for rare cancers, such as MCC, is challenging owing to difficulties in conducting large-scale trials, resulting in small sample sizes and therefore lacking statistical power. Thus, to comprehensively understand the available clinical evidence on various immunotherapy approaches for MCC, we also delve into the epidemiology and immune biology of this cancer. Nevertheless, while randomized studies directly comparing immune checkpoint inhibitors and chemotherapy in MCC are lacking, immunotherapy shows response rates comparable to those previously reported with chemotherapy but with more enduring responses. Notably, adjuvant nivolumab has proven superiority to the standard-of-care therapy (observation) in the adjuvant setting. Key Points Merkel cell carcinoma is an uncommon type of skin cancer that behaves aggressively. It is caused by either a virus or exposure to sunlight, making it highly likely to trigger the body’s immune response. Until recently, standard chemotherapy for advanced Merkel cell carcinoma provided only short-lived ben- efits, typically lasting around 3 months. However, since 2017, new drugs called PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, such as avelumab, pembrolizumab, nivolumab, and retifanlimab, have shown great promise in clinical trials. Because Merkel cell carcinoma induces strong immune responses, it often develops ways to avoid being attacked by the body’s immune system. This unfortunately also leads to primary and secondary resistance to PD-1/ PD-L1 gene inhibitors. Researchers are now testing combinations of different treatments to overcome this problem. * Jürgen C.

542 J. C. Becker et al. 1 Epidemiology Examining the epidemiology of Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) poses challenges owing to its extreme rarity. Valu- able population-based data regarding incidence and survival can only be reliably obtained from cancer registries covering large populations. Utilizing routine mortality statistics on the basis of ICD-10 coded causes of death is impractical for MCC, as it cannot be distinguished through the ICD-10 code C44 (pertaining to other malignant neoplasms of the skin). The evaluation of specialized disease registries at referral centers usually allows a more detailed characterization of MCC, a more precise description of the therapy and the course of the disease in terms of progression or recurrence. However, the disadvantage of such special registries is the lack of reference to a clearly defined population, which is why epidemiological measures, such as incidence, cannot be determined on this data basis. There is also a risk that the survival probabilities of MCC patients in these special registries are not representative of the population owing to potential selection bias. In an attempt to show the current incidence of MCC worldwide and the trend in incidence over time, data from high quality population-based cancer registries from 20 nations for the period 1990–2007 and for 21 nations for the most recent period 2003–2007 were analyzed [1]. In the majority of populations, the incidence of MCC has increased over time. Exceptions were Black populations in the USA, populations in Japan, Norway, and Denmark, where the incidence remained stable over time. The rise in incidence may stem from enhanced MCC recording in cancer registries, improved histopathological diagnostics, and increased awareness among physicians and patients. A recent time trend analysis of SEER data indicates that the increase in incidence is attributable to both a period effect (reflecting changing diagnostics and awareness) and a birth cohort effect, the latter indicating an increase in MCC risk factors [2]. Nations with the highest MCC incidence (expressed as cases per million, World Standard Population) in the period 2003–2007 were Australia (men: 5.2, women: 2.2), New Zealand (4.5, women: 3.2), and the USA (white popula- tion, men: 4.2, women: 1.9). Within the US, where multiple ethnicities live and for which population-based incidence rates are available, the following ethnicities are affected by MCC in descending order: non-Hispanic white, Hispanic, American Indian, Asian & Pacific Islander, and Black [1]. The occurrence of Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) exhib- its an exponential increase with advancing age, typically manifesting between 70 and 80 years. Notably, MCC is rare in younger individuals, as evidenced by a mere 0.07% of cases under the age of 30 years in a SEER data analysis comprising 27,105 MCC cases. Among these cases, 75% were in the 20–29 year age range, and interestingly, they tended to be diagnosed at more advanced stages. The reasons behind this observation, whether linked to heightened MCC aggressiveness or diagnostic delays in younger age groups, remain unclear [3]. Moreover, consistent findings indicate a higher incidence of MCC in men compared with women, with a predilection for occurring on the skin of the head and extremities [1, 4–7]. Apart from advanced age and prolonged exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, individuals with compromised immune systems face heightened risks of developing MCC. In a cohort of 309,365 patients with acquired immu- nodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), the risk of MCC was 13.4 times higher compared with the general population, which however dropped to 3.15 during the era of antiretroviral therapy [8, 9]. Similarly, a record linkage of the Registry of Transplant Recipients, involving 189,498 solid organ transplant recipients and data from 15 population-based cancer registries in the USA, revealed that the MCC risk after organ transplantation surged to 23.8 times higher

Recipients, involving 189,498 solid organ transplant recipients and data from 15 population-based cancer registries in the USA, revealed that the MCC risk after organ transplantation surged to 23.8 times higher than in the general population. Specific immunosuppres- sive medications such as azathioprine, cyclosporine, and mTOR inhibitors were associated with an increased risk of MCC [10]. This risk increased over time post-trans- plantation and varied on the basis of the organ type, with the highest risk observed after kidney transplantation. This notion may be owing to the medication patients were receiving prior to transplantation for renal insufficiency. A recent nationwide case-control study on MCC demon- strated that a cumulative dose of ≥ 50,000 mg of hydro- chlorothiazide correlated with a 2.3-fold increased rate of MCC. Similarly, a cumulative dose of ≥ 2,000 defined daily doses (DDD) of furosemide was linked to a 1.9-fold increased rate of MCC [11]. Remarkably, individuals who receive organ transplants and later develop MCC tend to be approximately 10 years younger than MCC cases in the general population [12]. Additionally, individuals with a history of previous cancer are also at an elevated risk of MCC. An analysis of US SEER data, encompassing 5.4 million cancer patients, demonstrated a 43% increased risk of MCC [Statistical Information on Recidivism (SIR) = 1.43] in this group. Notably, individuals with a history of other non-epithelial skin cancers (SIR = 4.20) or lympho- cytic leukemias (SIR = 6.31) faced a particularly high risk of developing MCC [13]. Population-based cancer registries primarily assess the survival probability of MCC patients at a population level. However, they are typically not optimized for determin- ing recurrence-free or progression-free survival owing to incomplete reporting of recurrences or progressions, even in mandatory reporting cases.

543 Immunotherapy for Merkel Cell Carcinoma probability can be determined using cause of death statis- tics or relative survival probabilities. However, cause of death statistics, based on ICD-10 codes, may be impre- cise and error-prone, potentially leading to confusion with other skin neoplasms. Relative survival probabilities, com- paring observed and expected survival on the basis of the general population life table, are more valid owing to their accuracy. Eight publications provide diverse 5-year relative sur- vival estimates from population-based registries. The 5-year relative survival probability varies significantly based on population, age, sex, and calendar time, ranging from 36% (Finland, men, 1983–2004) [5] to 84% (Germany, women, 2007–2011) [14]. Despite this variability, a consistent trend emerges: women consistently exhibit higher 5-year relative survival probabilities than men. In five of the eight publica- tions, survival rates were adjusted for various confounders, particularly tumor stage through Cox modeling. Notably, a clear and consistent sex difference in favor of women per- sists in all five analyses (Table 1). In addition to sex, other prognostic factors include TNM stage and immunosuppres- sion [15]. Immunosuppression, defined as a hematologic neoplasia, AIDS, or a condition after organ transplantation was associated with a multiple-adjusted hazard ratio (dis- ease-specific mortality) of 2.80 in a UK-wide cohort study [6]. In another cohort study, immunosuppression was associ- ated with an increased risk of MCC recurrence [hazard ratio (HR) = 2.40] [16]. 2 Immunobiology Initiation of MCC can result from either genetic alterations induced by UV light or infection, including the integration of Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) into the host cell genome [17]. However, not all genetic alterations or infec- tions lead to tumor formation. Protective mechanisms exist to prevent the proliferation of nonfunctional or noncooperat- ing cells within tissues. For instance, the DNA repair system can address many daily occurring DNA lesions [18], and intrinsic tumor suppressive mechanisms curb inappropriate cell expansion [19]. In cases where damage is extensive and irreparable, cells may undergo apoptosis or enter senescence [20]. If these mechanisms fail, the immune system poses a powerful extrinsic system to detect, prevent, and eliminate tumor growth. 2.1 Innate and Adaptive Immune Responses Innate immunity represents the first line of immunological defense. Its cellular constituents are myeloid cells [mac- rophages, neutrophils, dendritic cells (DC)] and innate lym- phoid cells (ILCs). ILCs are lymphocytes that do not express specific receptors and can be divided into five distinct sub- sets: NK cells, lymphoid-tissue inducer, and group 1, 2, and 3 ILCs (ILC1-3) [21]. For the detection of target cells they express both activating and inhibitory receptors, such as nat- ural cytotoxicity receptors, killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors, and the type II transmembrane C-type lectin-like receptor NKG2D, and thus their activation status depends on the cooperation of activating and inhibiting signals [21].

544 J. C. Becker et al. Innate immune cells exhibit swift cytolytic responses to tumor cells but struggle to control established solid tumors effectively [22]. Conversely, adaptive immune responses, while requiring time to develop, are specific and enduring [23]. While γδ-T cells are at the crossroad of innate and adaptive immunity, peptide-specific ­CD8+ cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) are the ultimate effector cells of adaptive immunity [23]. However, initiation of adaptive antitumor immune responses require innate immune cells to recognize tumor cells, which will lead to their activation and acquire effector functions. For example, activated macrophages, DCs, neu- trophils, and mast cells produce chemokines and cytokines like interferons and interleukins, which can recruit other immune cells to the tumor microenvironment (TME) [24]. Furthermore, activated NK cells will be the first to induce immunogenic cell death and these dying tumor cells will release antigens efficiently taken up by DCs for presentation to T cells. One DC subtype is particularly important since the initiation of cytotoxic antitumor CD8+ T cell responses by cross-priming is mainly mediated by them: type-1 con- ventional DCs (cDC1s) [25]. They are equipped to efficiently uptake antigen from dying cells, deliver cell-associated antigen to early endosomes, and owing to lower proteolysis show increased antigen retention [25]. Captured antigen is processed into small fragments, loaded onto MHC class I molecules, transported to the cell surface where this peptide/ MHC class I complexes are presented to CD8+ T cells [26]. Those CD8 T cells, which encounter their cognate antigen presented by a cDC1 will be activated, and in the presence of additional costimulatory signals will undergo clonal expan- sion to form the population of antigen-specific CTLs able to recognize and eliminate cells expressing the same antigen [27, 28]. The process of CD4+ T-cell response priming is similar with cDC2s being potent stimulators, and antigen is presented as peptide/MHC class II complexes [29]. For the priming of T cells the antigen-loaded DCs will normally migrate to the tumor draining lymph node where they encounter thousands of T cells, which serves to accelerate the initiation and execution of specific immune responses (Fig. 1) [30]. Primed CD8+ T cells will translo- cate to the tumor to recognize, bind, and in the best case kill the tumor cells. However, adaptive immune responses can also be primed in tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs). TLSs are characterized by an inner zone of B cells and an outer zone of T cells (Fig. 1) [31]. They can differ in their cellular composition, localization (stromal, peritumoral, and intratumoral) and maturation (lymphoid aggregate, pri- mary follicle, and secondary follicle) [31]. In several tumor entities, including MCC, TLSs are associated with a better prognosis [32, 33]. Compared with priming in lymph nodes, an in situ priming in TLSs could offer the advantages of speed, efficiency with primed cells more likely to encounter cognate antigen, more unique immune responses owing to the effect of local tissue factors, and better survival of lym- phocytes [31]. The immunoediting process, outlined in phases of elimi- nation, equilibrium, and escape, delineates the interplay between immune responses and developing tumors [34]. The elimination phase marks the commencement of innate and adaptive immunity, aiming to eliminate malignant or transformed tumor cells before clinical detection. If tumor cells exhibit low immunogenicity, they may progress to the equilibrium phase. In this phase, the interaction between adaptive immunity and tumor cells reaches a stable bal- ance, hindering complete tumor elimination by the immune system and preventing tumor cells from escaping immune surveillance. In the escape phase, immune response limita- tions allow unrestricted tumor cell proliferation, leading to clinically apparent tumors. Significantly, immune

immune system and preventing tumor cells from escaping immune surveillance. In the escape phase, immune response limita- tions allow unrestricted tumor cell proliferation, leading to clinically apparent tumors. Significantly, immune suppres- sion and advancing age stand out as primary risk factors for MCC. The latter, likely attributed to immunosenescence, denotes the gradual decline of the immune system with age [35]. Both factors are likely contributors to the progression into the escape phase. 2.2 MCC is an Immunogenic Tumor Considering that immunosuppression is a major risk fac- tor for MCC [8, 10, 15, 36], and given the occurrence of spontaneous regression, including complete regression, with over 40 documented cases to date, MCC is viewed as an immunogenic cancer [37, 38]. In this regard, both the UV- and viral carcinogenesis readily explain MCC’s immuno- genicity (Fig. 2A). For UV-associated MCC the etiologic factor is UV-induced mutagenesis. Thus, in contrast to the virus-associated MCC, these tumors display a high tumor mutational burden [39, 40], which should translate into numerous neoantigens. Indeed, in a recently published case report, Church et al. were able to identify and characterize tumor-specific Th1-skewed CD4+ T cells targeting several different neoantigens in a patient with a UV-associated MCC [41]. After the identification of MCPyV in 2008 [42], more than 35 publications verified an overall combined prevalence rate of MCPyV in MCC of 80% [43]. Importantly, virus- associated MCC are not only characterized by the expres- sion of virally encoded oncoproteins, i.e., the small and large T antigen (TA) [44], but they are actually dependent on TA expression for their growth [44, 45]. Notably, viral proteins presented by MHC molecules are often immuno- genic [46], thus viral proteins appear to be eminent antigens shared between patients with virus-associated MCC [47, 48]. Indeed, numerous immunogenic MCPyV TA-derived epitopes, tailored to various HLA haplotypes, have been identified [49, 50]. This discovery not only enables the

545 Immunotherapy for Merkel Cell Carcinoma monitoring of immune responses, but also presents potential new targets for T-cell-based therapies. Intratumoral infiltra- tion by MCPyV-specific T cells was associated with sig- nificantly improved MCC-specific survival, suggesting that augmenting the number or avidity of virus-specific T cells may have therapeutic benefit [51]. Moreover, a close interac- tion between MCPyV-specific T cells and MCC tumor cells can be deduced by the observation that the frequency of MCPyV-specific T cells correlated with tumor burden, i.e., increased upon tumor progression and decreased upon effi- cient therapy rendering the patient tumor free [52]. MCPyV large T antigen seems to be the major tumor-specific antigen present in virus-associated MCC: when tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) obtained from MCC tumors were ana- lyzed for specificity against three viral proteins, 80% of Fig. 1. Tumor antigen cross-presentation for priming of tumor- specific T cells. (1) Upon immunogenic cell death, damage-associ- ated molecular patterns (DAMPs) are presented or released by the tumor cells. For example, dying cells will translocate calreticulin to the cell surface, release high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) pro- tein, Annexin A1 (AXNA1) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and secrete type I interferons. (2) Immature dendritic cells (DCs) sense these DAMPs by pattern recognition receptors. This leads to matura- tion of the DCs and increased phagocytosis of released tumor anti- gens, which are subsequently processed and presented to T cells. (3) DCs migrate to the lymph node via the afferent lymphatic vessels. They might also migrate into tertiary lymphoid structures present at the tumor (in this case a peritumoral location is depicted). (4) In the lymph node and maybe also in TLS priming of T cells will take place. Depicted for cross priming of CD8+ T cells, full activation and clonal expansion of the T cells require three signals: (1) recognition of the MHC class I/peptide complex by the TCR, (2) costimulation of CD28 by B7 ligand, and (3) cytokines binding to cytokine receptor. (5) Primed T cells will leave the lymph node via efferent lymphatic vessel and are recruited to the tumor microenvironment where they can attack tumor cells expressing their cognate peptide

546 J. C. Becker et al. identified T-cell responses were reacting to the large T anti- gen [53]. 2.3 Immune Escape Mechanisms of MCC Therefore, both etiologies of MCC lead to an immunogenic tumor, with a more robust immune response noted in virus- associated MCC. Consequently, an improved prognosis is linked to both increased numbers of intratumoral CD8+ T cells and the quality of the infiltrate [54, 55]. However, the number of cases with a high intratumoral CD8 infiltration is rather low, implying that immune evasion mechanisms are present in MCC. A physiological mechanism to avert harm from exces- sive immune responses involves inducing an exhausted state when T cells face chronic inflammation or prolonged expo- sure to antigens [56]. This process unfolds gradually, transi- tioning from PD1+TCF1+ precursor exhausted T cells (Tpex) with retained proliferation capability to a fully exhausted state (Tex; PD1+TCF-) [57]. Tex is distinguished by elevated expression of co-inhibitory receptors, such as PD1, LAG3, CTLA-4, and TIM3. While Tex lacks proliferation capac- ity, it appears to regain cytotoxic potential when compared Fig. 2. Antigenicity and immune escape in MCC. A On the basis of the different etiological factors leading to MCC development, VN- MCC should be able to present neoantigens while VP-MCC present TA-derived antigens.

547 Immunotherapy for Merkel Cell Carcinoma with Tpex [57, 58]. The process involves the dysregulation of multiple signaling pathways, transcriptional programs, and epigenetic alterations. It is not only triggered by per- sistent antigen encounter but is also shaped by the tumor microenvironment (TME). For instance, factors such as nutrition restrictions, hypoxia, and immunosuppressive cells and signals render the TME immunosuppressive [59, 60]. T cell exhaustion is an important immune escape mecha- nism in MCC: a significant proportion of TILs express PD-1 and TIM-3, which are not only regarded as the exhaustion markers, but actually promote T-cell dysfunction [52, 61]. Activation and proliferation of T cells are inhibited through PD-1 signaling. When PD-1 is stimulated by binding to its ligands (PD-L1 or PD-L2), it undergoes phosphorylation, enabling the recruitment and activation of Src homology region 2 domain-containing phosphatase (SHP-2). This, in turn, results in the dephosphorylation of critical signaling molecules downstream of the T cell receptor (TCR). The downstream signaling pathways activated by TIM-3 involve the coupling of TIM-3 to TCR signaling pathways, leading to the modulation of T cell function [62]. On binding to galectin 9 or CEACAM1, Tyr256 and Tyr263 in the intra- cellular domain of TIM3 are phosphorylated. This phos- phorylation releases BAT3 and facilitates the recruitment of the tyrosine kinase FYN. Consequently, immune synapse formation is disrupted and phosphatase recruitment ensues. Ultimately, the cell becomes anergic or undergoes apopto- sis, mediated by intracellular calcium release. Additionally, phosphatidylserine released from apoptotic cells can bind to the FG–CC′ cleft-binding site on TIM3. Another prominent immune escape mechanism in MCC is the downregulation of MHC class I molecules. To attack tumor cells, primed T cells have to recognize their target cells via binding of the TCR to cognate antigen presented on MHC complexes. Hence, tumor cells with impaired antigen presentation become unnoted by T cells. In a study with MCC cell lines, we observed that in most of the analyzed cell lines the expression of members of the antigen presenta- tion machinery, i.e., subunits of the proteasome required for degradation of antigen into peptides, transporters associated with antigen processing and antigen presentation molecules, is impaired [63]. MYC-L and the non-canonical polycomb repressive complex 1.1 (PRC1.1) have been recognized as HLA-class I repressors in MCC [64]. In virus-associated MCCs, the recruitment of MYC-L by the small T antigen to the EP300 complex appears to be responsible. On the other hand, in UV-associated MCC, amplification of the LMYC gene may lead to heightened MYC-L expression and subsequently result in suppressed HLA class I expression. In accordance with these in vitro observations, MHC class I expression is absent or low in most MCC cases [63–66]. However, down- regulation of MHC class I enhances the immunogenicity for NK cells. Notably, MCC cells prevent activation of NK cells by downregulating the expression of MICA and MICB, i.e., the ligands for the activating NKG2D receptor [65]. Downregulation of HLA class I and MICA/B expression is owing to epigenetic silencing and thus can be restored by histone deacetylases, interferons, and inhibitor of USP7, a component of the PRC1.1 complex [63–66]. The interaction between tumor cells and T cells can also be prevented by spatial separation. Indeed, CD8+ T cells are often found only in the vicinity of MCC, but not infiltrating into the tumor [54, 67]. For T cells to infiltrate tumors from the bloodstream, the presence of E-selectin on blood vessel walls is crucial. In MCCs, however, intratumoral vascular E-selectin was predominantly downregulated, and the fre- quency of E-selectin-positive vessels within the tumor cor- related with the extent of intratumoral CD8+ infiltrate [68]. Consistent with studies highlighting the

vascular E-selectin was predominantly downregulated, and the fre- quency of E-selectin-positive vessels within the tumor cor- related with the extent of intratumoral CD8+ infiltrate [68]. Consistent with studies highlighting the favorable impact of intratumoral CD8+ T cell infiltration on prognosis, the patient group with a low fraction of E-selectin-positive ves- sels exhibited the poorest MCC-specific survival. The cGAS-STING pathway plays a crucial role in regu- lating innate and adaptive immunity by sensing cytosolic pathological DNA, where STING serves as a key adaptor for inducing interferon type I and other proinflammatory cytokines [69]. In MCC, STING expression is suppressed. Restoring STING expression in MCC cells and using a STING agonist reactivates their antitumor inflammatory cytokine production. Additionally, MCPyV-specific T cells exhibit enhanced migration and tumor cell killing when cocultured with MCC cells with restored STING [70]. Finally, intratumoral injection of a STING agonist resulted in a lasting clinical response in MCC patients. This was accompanied by expansion of cancer-specific T cells [71]. 2.4 Immunological Effects of Immune Checkpoint Inhibition On the basis of the observations that MCCs are immuno- genic and TILs expedite the activation and exhaustion mark- ers PD-1 on the one hand and PD-L1 on tumor and stromal cells on the other [61, 72, 73], it was postulated early on that this tumor entity should be well susceptible to immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy, especially antibodies that block the PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway. However, the eco- nomic viability of introducing a therapy in a rare type of cancer is relatively limited; thus, it took some time for this hypothesis to be put to the test. As we will explore further, once conducted, these studies revealed that first-line anti- PD-(L)1 therapies elicited objective responses in over half of the patients with advanced MCC. TCR repertoire analysis of TIL revealed an association of low T-cell clonality but high TCR diversity with response to ICI, while in nonresponders terminally differentiated

548 J. C. Becker et al. effector cells (most likely ­Tex) with a constrained TCR rep- ertoire prevailed [74]. Upon ICI therapy, responders demon- strated a more pronounced and diverse clonal expansion of TILs. Expanding this study demonstrated that dense CD8+ T cells infiltrate near tumor cells in lesions obtained before treatment was associated with a favorable response to ICI [75]. Moreover, the infiltrate of patients experiencing disease control upon ICI was predominated by cells co-expressing CD45RO, CD27, and TCF1, which are markers for central memory cells (but also for ­Tpex). In murine tumor models anti-PD-1 treatment led to an increase in the population of Tpex among TILs and facilitated their differentiation into Tex, the cell type able to kill tumor cells in direct cytotoxic- ity assays [58]. In a study involving melanoma and MCC patients, the presence of PD-1+TIGIT+CD8 T cells in the blood post-treatment initiation was identified as a predictor of anti-PD-1 therapy efficacy [76]. The PD-1+TIGIT+CD8 T cells appeared to be heterogeneous probably consisting of activated, exhausted, and cytotoxic follicular T cells char- acterized by the expression of CXCR5. This is in line with a report demonstrating that CXCR5 served as a marker for PD-1+ T cells with self-renewal capacities responsible for the proliferation in the blood upon anti-PD-1 therapy [77]. Accordingly, increased frequency and absolute number of TCR-beta clonotypes emerging on PD-1 blockade in the PD- 1+TIGIT+CD8 T cell population correlated with clinical benefit [76]. PD-1 therapy has the potential to replace exhausted clo- notypes by their contraction and by activation of new highly tumor-reactive clonotypes, i.e., by the de novo priming of cytotoxic T cells [76, 78, 79]. Alternatively, the expansion pre-existing clonotypes have also been described [80–82]. As discussed above, priming and expansion of new T cell clones occur in secondary lymphoid organs or TLSs. Evi- dence for both scenarios have been reported: (1) subsets of Tpex cells found in tumor-free draining lymph nodes were clonally related to Tex present in the tumor [83]. Moreover, upon anti-PD-1 therapy, the frequency of Tpex observed in close proximity to DCs decreased while the more differenti- ated intermediate-exhausted T cells became more abundant. This change in the lymph node correlated with an increase of proliferating intermediate-exhausted T cells in the blood implying an important role for the lymph nodes in mediating responses to ICI. (2) For several cancer entities the presence of TLSs is predictive for patients’ responses to anti-PD-1 therapy [84, 85] and induction of TLSs upon ICI therapy was observed after neoadjuvant therapy [86]. It's crucial to emphasize that while half of patients with advanced MCC benefit from ICI therapy, the remaining half do not. This lack of persistent benefit can be attributed to either no response at all (primary resistance) or relapse after an initial positive response (secondary resistance). The resistance has been attributed to the extent or the induction/ amplification of the immune escape mechanisms mentioned earlier—namely, dysfunctional T cells, inhibition of the interaction between MCC and T cells, and the immunosup- pressive TME. For example, analyses of pre- and posttreat- ment tumor lesions of a MCC patient with acquired resist- ance to adoptive MCPyV-specific T cell therapy revealed transcriptional suppression of the HLA genes [87]. This transcriptional suppression was owing to epigenetic regula- tion since treatment with hypomethylating agents reinduced HLA expression. Similarly, treatment with histone deacety- lase inhibitor could also overcome HLA class I downregula- tion in ICI-resistant MCC patients, but the effect on clinical response has yet to be determined in a larger cohort [88]. Concerning the immunosuppressive TME, one myeloid population stands out as particularly noteworthy: tumor- associated macrophages (TAM), identified by

clinical response has yet to be determined in a larger cohort [88]. Concerning the immunosuppressive TME, one myeloid population stands out as particularly noteworthy: tumor- associated macrophages (TAM), identified by the expres- sion of CD163, CD14, and S100A8. In a study involving 54 MCC patients, a greater prevalence of TAMs was linked to resistance to PD-1 blockade [89]. Numerous additional mechanisms to evade the immune system have been identified in various tumor types. These mechanisms include, for example, the loss of immuno- dominant antigens or the insensitivity of tumor cells to cytokines secreted by T cells. The latter is achieved by the downregulation or mutation of proteins responsible for recognizing and responding to immune effector signals [90–93]. At present, it has not yet been described that these immune escape mechanisms are also active in MCC. 3 Immunotherapy Until recently, recommendations for the systemic therapy of advanced MCC primarily relied on data derived from single-center retrospective analyses. Additionally, rec- ommendations were drawn from data extrapolated from other tumor types and individual experiences. Despite advancements in comprehending the disease’s biology and the availability of systematic retrospective data col- lections, along with various prospective therapeutic trials, the absence of prospective randomized studies has limited the ability to compare different systemic therapies. Never- theless, a comparison of key parameters, such as response rates, response duration, survival times, and toxicity sug- gests that immunotherapy with PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors stands out as the most promising systemic treat- ment. Chemotherapy and alternative treatments may be considered as secondary options. In this respect it is important to acknowledge some of the particularities of MCC patients with respect to

549 Immunotherapy for Merkel Cell Carcinoma outcome measures, specifically overall versus disease- specific survival [94]. Overall survival (OS) refers to the duration from the date of initiation of therapy until death from any cause. It is a comprehensive measure that consid- ers all causes of death, not just those related to the specific disease being studied. In contrast, disease-specific survival (DSS) focuses solely on the duration from start of therapy until death owing to the specific disease, i.e., MCC, under investigation. It excludes deaths from unrelated causes, providing a more targeted measure of how well patients are surviving with that particular disease. While OS is universally accepted measure of direct benefit as it is eas- ily measurable and provides a comprehensive view by considering all causes of death, in an elderly population, however, it may be influenced by comorbidities, poten- tially complicating result interpretation. In this respect, DSS excludes deaths from unrelated causes, offering a clearer picture of disease-specific outcome; however, it may not capture the overall impact of the treatment on patient health and well-being, especially in cases where treatment related factors, e.g., myelodepression caused by chemotherapy or autoimmune events by ICI, contribute to mortality. Thus, more limited in scope compared with OS, DSS is potentially overlooking broader health considera- tions in elderly patients [95]. 3.1 PD‑1/PD‑L1‑Directed Immune Checkpoint Inhibition PD-1 and its ligand PD-L1 play a pivotal role in immune evasion by cancer cells. MCC often exhibits overexpression of PD-L1, creating an immunosuppressive microenviron- ment [75]. PD-1 inhibitors, such as pembrolizumab and nivolumab, or PD-L1 inhibitors, such as avelumab, disrupt this interaction, reactivating T cell responses against MCC cells. Clinical trials evaluating PD-1 inhibitors have demon- strated remarkable efficacy in MCC. Prospective single- arm studies are available for both PD-1 (pembrolizumab, nivolumab, and retifanlimab) and PD-L1 (avelumab) block- ing targeted antibodies (Table 2). Pembrolizumab was the first immune checkpoint inhibitor investigated in MCC patients, and has shown durable responses, leading to accel- erated FDA approval for metastatic MCC. Nivolumab as well as avelumab have also shown promising results, high- lighting the therapeutic potential of targeting the PD-1/ PD-L1 axis. The first published phase-II trial on checkpoint immu- notherapy for MCC reported on 50 treatment-naive meta- static patients, who were treated with pembrolizumab [96]. The objective response rate was 56% (complete response 24%; partial response 32%). After a median follow-up of 15 months, the median response duration had not been reached. The progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 24 months was 48%, with a median PFS of 16.8 months. The overall sur- vival (OS) rate at 24 months was 69%, with the median OS not reached. Interestingly, the MCPyV status determined in the patients’ tumor tissue samples did not correlate with the objective response rate, PFS, or OS of the respective patients under pembrolizumab. However, a trend toward improvement in PFS and OS was described in patients with PD-L1-positive tumors compared with PD-L1-negative tumors. On the basis of these encouraging study results, pembrolizumab was approved by the FDA for the treatment of advanced MCC. A further phase-II trial evaluated the PD-L1 antibody avelumab in advanced non-resectable MCC patients who had previously received at least one cytostatic pretreatment [97]. Among 88 patients, an objective response rate of 33% Table 2 PD-1/PD-L1 blockade in metastatic MCC Clinical Trial NCT0215567A NCT0215567B NCT02267603 NCT02488759 NCT03599713 Antibody Avelumab Avelumab Pembrolizumab Nivolumab Retifanlimab Target PD-L1 PD-L1 PD-1 PD-1 PD-1 Median follow-up time 40.8 months 21.2 months 14.9 months 12.0 months 17.6 months Number of prior therapies (PrT) ≥ 1 0 0 0 to ≥ 1 0

550 J. C. Becker et al. was achieved after a median follow-up of 40.8 months, with a median response duration of 40.5 months. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 2.7 months, with a PFS rate at 24 months of 26%. The median overall survival (OS) was 12.6 months, and the OS rate was 31% after 42 months. Subgroup analyses suggested a higher likelihood of response for patients with fewer prior systemic therapy lines, lower tumor burden, and PD-L1-positive tumors. However, sus- tained response occurred independently of these baseline factors, including MCPyV status. The study was subse- quently expanded to include patients in the first-line setting [98]. In 29 evaluable patients with more than 3 months of follow-up, a response rate of 62% was observed; 16 of the 18 responders were already observed at the first staging after 6 weeks. On the basis of these positive study data, avelumab was approved by the FDA and EMA for the treatment of advanced MCC. The latest FDA approval was granted to retifanlimab on the basis of data from the POD1UM-201 trial [99, 100]. This open-label, multiregional, single-arm study assessed retifan- limab in adults with metastatic or recurrent locally advanced MCC who had not undergone prior systemic therapy for their advanced disease. In chemotherapy-naive patients (n = 101), retifanlimab monotherapy demonstrated an objective response rate (ORR) of 54%, as independently evaluated by central review using RECIST v1.1. Notably, 17% achieved a complete response, and 37% achieved a partial response. In contrast to the other trials, patients with a tumor PD-L1 expression greater than 1% showed a significantly better response than those with lower PD-L1 expression. Among the responding patients, the duration of response varied from 1.1 to 24.9+ months. Three-fourths experienced a response lasting more than 6 months, and 62% had a response lasting more than 12 months according to landmark analysis. Seri- ous adverse reactions occurred in 22% of patients receiving retifanlimab, with the most frequent serious adverse reac- tions being fatigue, arrhythmia, and pneumonitis. Permanent discontinuation owing to adverse reactions occurred in 11% of patients [101]. All the mentioned clinical trials on PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibition share the characteristic that clinical responses were observed independent of the MCPyV status and PD-L1 expression. Although a response is possible even with a high tumor burden, the early initiation of checkpoint immunotherapy with a low tumor burden proves to be more favorable in all the mentioned studies. In addition to the presented clinical trials since the reg- istration of the first ICIs, real-world data have been col- lected and reported [75, 102, 103]. Levy at al. reported on 54 patients receiving avelumab as the first-line treatment for 74% of patients, with 15% having locally advanced disease. In line with previous experience, the overall response rate was 57%, with 24% achieving a complete response. PFS was 8.6 months and median OS was 25.8 months. Another study on a large multicenter cohort comprising 114 patients treated with different PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors indicated that the absence of immunosuppression, a limited number of tumor- affected organ sites, and a predominance of CD8+ memory T cells among the tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes are base- line characteristics predicting a favorable response to PD-1/ PD-L1 immunotherapy in patients with advanced MCC and should be considered when making treatment decisions [75]. In a recent review article, the published real-world data on the efficacy of avelumab has been summarized [103]. It is important to note that a systematic review and Bayesian net- work meta-analysis of ICIs in solid-organ cancers compris- ing 10,673 patients reported that avelumab was associated with significantly lower OS compared with nivolumab and pembrolizumab (HR 1.37, 95% CI 1.05–1.78 and HR 1.33, 95% CI 1.02–1.73, respectively) [104].

patients reported that avelumab was associated with significantly lower OS compared with nivolumab and pembrolizumab (HR 1.37, 95% CI 1.05–1.78 and HR 1.33, 95% CI 1.02–1.73, respectively) [104]. The optimal duration of treatment ICI in metastatic can- cers is uncertain, especially for patients who do not achieve radiologic complete remission. Many face progressive disease after discontinuation of ICI. Extending treatment, however, often poses logistical challenges. In a retrospec- tive study on 23 patients with advanced melanoma (n = 18) or MCC (n = 5) received ICI therapy at reduced dose fre- quency every 3 months after initial disease control at stand- ard dose frequency. After frequency reduction, the 3-year progression-free survival was 73% in melanoma and 100% in patients with MCC [105]. However, among a cohort of 65 patients, those 25 who achieved a complete response (CR) on positron emission tomography–computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging seem to maintain lasting responses even after discontinuing treatment for a year. Only two patients (8%) experienced a recurrence following the cessation of avelumab treatment [106]. 3.2 CTLA‑4 Directed Therapies For patients who do not respond or no longer respond to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapy, off-label therapy with the combination of the anti-CTLA-4 antibody ipilimumab plus nivolumab may be considered. Case reports and retrospec- tive case series exist on this therapy combination, reporting controversial efficacy data. One report from Harvard Medi- cal School on 13 patients with metastatic MCC who received ipilimumab plus nivolumab after failure of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy found no objective responses in their patient cohort (0/13 patients achieved a complete or partial response; 3/13 achieved stable disease as the best overall response but progressed shortly thereafter) [108]. The median pro- gression-free survival was 1.3 months; the median overall survival was 4.7 months. Subsequent multicenter retro- spective study reports from German skin cancer centers indicated a high response rate of PD-1/PD-L1-refractory

551 Immunotherapy for Merkel Cell Carcinoma MCC to combination immunotherapy with ipilimumab plus nivolumab [109]. The first prospective trial evaluating ipilimumab plus nivolumab in advanced MCC included patients in the first- line or second-line setting, treated with combined immu- notherapy plus or minus stereotactic body radiation [110]. Among the 50 patients treated, 100% of the previously immunotherapy-naive patients responded (22/22), including nine (41%) complete responses. Of the patients who had pre- viously had immunotherapy exposure, 31% (8/26 patients) had an objective response. The additional stereotyctic body radiation therapy did not improve the efficacy of combined nivolumab and ipilimumab. On the basis of these promising results, the combination of nivolumab plus ipilimumab represents a good second-line therapeutic option for advanced MCC patients after failure of PD-1/PD-L1 fist-line treatment; however in the absence of an FDA and EMA approval status. 3.3 Novel Immunotherapy Strategies Several strategies have been developed to induce and enhance the immunogenicity of skin tumors, mainly mela- noma. Some of those have also been investigated in MCC. Single case reports and small case series document the successful use of oncolytic virus therapy with talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC), either as monotherapy or in com- bination with PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibiting antibodies, in advanced MCC patients [111, 112]. T-VEC is administered intratumorally and is intended to increase the immunogenicity of the treated tumors through enhanced antigen presentation and thus tumor cell recognition. In the largest reported case series of four patients, complete remission of MCC tumors was achieved in all four cases under T-VEC treatment [111]. However, prospective studies evaluating T-VEC for MCC are currently lacking. T-VEC has EMA approval only for metastatic melanoma; its use in MCC has to be considered as off-label use. A similar approach is used in the combination of the oncolytic vaccine vusolimogene oderparepvec (RP1) plus nivolumab, which has been investigated in PD-1/PD-L1-re- fractory melanoma as well as non-melanoma skin cancer within the phase-2 trial IGNYTE (NCT03767348). The non- melanoma skin cancer cohort includes MCC, and the first encouraging results have been reported. Among 12 patients with nonmelanoma skin cancer resistant to PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy, the objective response rate for RP1 plus nivolumab was 33.3%; these responses were observed in patients with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, MCC, and angiosarcoma. In MCC patients treated within the same trial in first-line (immunotherapy naive), three of four patients (75%) responded to the combination of RP1 plus nivolumab [113]. In initial attempts at utilizing adoptive T cell transfer (ACT) therapy, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) spe- cific to LT were expanded in vitro and reintroduced into the patient alongside high-dose IL-2. This approach led to the regression of some of the metastases in a patient with advanced Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) [114]. In a sub- sequent phase I/II trial exploring this approach as part of a multimodal strategy, together with upregulation of HLA expression of the MCC cells (via intratumoral injection of IFNβ or radiation therapy) and PD-L1 inhibition, all four included patients achieved an objective response [114]. Concurrently, a significant advancement in ACT involves genetically modifying autologous T cells ex vivo by intro- ducing T cell receptors (TCR) or chimeric antigen recep- tors (CAR) specific to tumor antigens. Despite CAR-T cell therapies gaining approval for hematological malignancies, their effectiveness in treating solid tumors remains limited. The ATTAC-MCC phase I/II study is investigating the safety and efficacy of engineered MCPyV-directed TCR T cells in cases of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-refractory dis- ease (NCT03747484).

the safety and efficacy of engineered MCPyV-directed TCR T cells in cases of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-refractory dis- ease (NCT03747484). Natural killer cells, being innate immune cells with intrin- sic properties, are considered ideal candidates for cellular immunotherapy in cancers that often exhibit a lack of MHC class I expression. The QUILT-3.009 phase 2 trial (regis- tered under NCT02465957, NCT03167164) has explored the use of allogeneic activated NK cell (aNK) therapy in the treatment of patients with Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC). Clinical benefits were observed in this trial when combin- ing aNK cell therapy with ALT-803, an IL-15 superagonist, resulting in two objective responses among 7 patients, with no reported safety concerns. Subsequently, the QUILT-3.055 trial is extending this approach by combining it with ave- lumab (registered under NCT03228667) [115]. A peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) target- ing somatostatin has been reported as effective in individ- ual cases and small case series when somatostatin receptor (SSTR) expression was detected on tumors and metastases [116]. In these cases, PRRT was administered either alone or in combination with chemo- or immunotherapy. The detec- tion of somatostatin receptors can be performed through SSTR PET/CT or SSTR PET/MRI. In a meta-analysis of somatostatin PRRT in metastatic neuroendocrine tumors across 13 studies, a pooled response rate of 28% was observed [117]. A retrospective case series of 19 patients with MCC treated with somatostatin PRRT demonstrated disease control in 43% of cases [118]. Most interestingly, in a recent case report a patient whose MCC progressed on multiple lines of ICI responded well to combined therapy with ipilimumab plus nivolumab ICI and somatostatin PRRT [119]. Specifically, the patient was resistant to first-line avelumab and acquired resistance to ipilimumab/nivolumab. After confirmation of SSTR

552 J. C. Becker et al. expression, ipilimumab/nivolumab treatment was combined with two cycles of PRRT Restaging after 3 months demon- strated an exceptional response. This case demonstrates the feasibility of combined treatment with ICI and PRRT as an option for MCC patients progressing under ICI. To confirm the additive value of this combination, the GoTHAM trial (NCT04261855) was recently launched. The three-armed design compares avelumab, avelumab plus radiotherapy, or avelumab plus PRRT and stratifies patients by SSTR expression. 3.4 Neoadjuvant and Adjuvant Immunotherapy Neoadjuvant therapy is given before surgery to help shrink a tumor or stop the disease from spreading, making it less invasive. On the other hand, adjuvant therapy is delivered after surgery to kill any remaining cancer cells in the patient. Both types of therapy aim to increase the success of the pri- mary treatment and decrease the risk of cancer recurrence. Even after complete resection and radiation of locore- gional disease, MCCs’ relapse rates are high. Given the outstanding effect of immunotherapy in the treatment of advanced MCC not-amendable to site-directed therapies, ICIs (ipilimumab, nivolumab, avelumab) are currently also being investigated in neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings. While initial reports did not find any therapeutic effects of ipilimumab monotherapy in the adjuvant use, the report of a nonrandomized neo-adjuvant trial and interim results of a prospective randomized trial indicate a benefit of the PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab regarding recurrence-free survival (RFS). In a subgroup of the CheckMate 358 trial described above, 39 patients with MCC (AJCC Stage IIA-IV) were treated with two doses of nivolumab in a neo-adjuvant set- ting [120]. Of the 36 patients who underwent surgical inter- vention 4 weeks after therapy start, 17 (47%) achieved a complete pathological response (pCR). Among 33 patients who underwent radiological tumor evaluation before sur- gery, 18 (55%) showed a tumor reduction of 30% or more. Again, the clinical response was independent of MCPyV, PD-L1, or tumor mutational burden status of the respec- tive tumors. After a median follow-up of 20.3 months, the median RFS and overall survival (OS) had not been reached; however, RFS significantly correlated with pCR and radio- logical response at the time of surgery. No patient with a pCR experienced tumor recurrence during the follow-up period. Three ongoing clinical trials addressing the effect of different ICI therapies, i.e., cemiplimab (NCT04975152), pembrolizumab (NCT05496036), and the combination of nivolumab and relatlimab (NCT06151236), in the neoadju- vant setting. Unfortunately, none of these prospective trials is randomized or exceeds number of patients treated in the subgroup of the CheckMate 358 trial. In a phase 2 multicenter trial (ADMEC-O, registered under NCT02196961), patients with MCC with no evi- dence of disease after complete surgical resection of lesions, regardless of stage but with an Eastern Cooperative Oncol- ogy Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1, were ran- domly assigned in a 2:1 ratio at 20 academic medical centers in Germany and the Netherlands. The assigned treatments were either nivolumab 480 mg every 4 weeks for a duration of 1 year or observation. Stratification was based on stage (AJCC stages 1–2 versus stages 3–4), age (< 65 versus ≥ 65 years), and sex. The primary endpoint was landmark RFS at 12 and 24 months, evaluated in the intention-to-treat popu- lations. Secondary endpoints included overall survival and safety assessments [121]. Over a span of 5 years, 179 patients were enrolled, with 65% in stages 3–4, 68% aged ≥ 65 years, and 62% being male. Stratification factors (stage, age, and sex) were evenly distributed between the nivolumab and observation groups; however, adjuvant radiotherapy was more prevalent in the control group. The interim analysis was conducted 1 year after the recruitment of the last patient. With a

nivolumab and observation groups; however, adjuvant radiotherapy was more prevalent in the control group. The interim analysis was conducted 1 year after the recruitment of the last patient. With a median follow-up of 2 years, the hazard ratio for RFS between the groups was 0.58, favoring the nivolumab group. The RFS rates in the nivolumab group were 85% at 12 months and 84% at 24 months, while in the observation group, they were 77% at 12 months and 73% at 24 months. Of note, previous adjuvant or concurrent adjuvant radiation was per- mitted in both groups, but more patients received it in the control group than those in the nivolumab group. Because postoperative radiotherapy is recommended in most guide- lines as an effective adjuvant treatment for this radiosensitive cancer, this fact might have disadvantaged the nivolumab group. Overall survival events rates, with ten events in the active treatment group and six events in the half-the-size observation group, are not mature enough to draw conclu- sions [121]. Most patients allocated nivolumab completed the 1-year course of treatment. Nonetheless, nivolumab- related adverse events—most commonly, pruritus, fatigue, and serum lipase elevations—occurred in 74% (grade 3–4 events in 20%) and led to treatment discontinuation in 15%. Notably, there were no reported treatment-related deaths. It is crucial to acknowledge that owing to the rarity of MCC, ADMEC-O is not a conventional superiority trial; rather, it is a randomized, exploratory phase-2 trial. This design was selected to address the challenge of lacking a valid reference for efficacy. Consequently, the trial did not seek statistical power to identify a significant difference, and the hazard ratios reported stem from a post-hoc analysis. The data from ADMEC-O indicate that adjuvant nivolumab is safe, well tolerated, and has promising activity in patients with MCC. Mature survival data are awaited (> 90% of patients in each group were alive at 2 years), as are results from the ongoing phase III trials of adjuvant avelumab

553 Immunotherapy for Merkel Cell Carcinoma (NCT04291885 and NCT03271372) and pembrolizumab (NCT03712605). 4 Conclusions Merkel cell carcinoma is characterized as an immunogenic tumor, showcasing a notable immune responsiveness. The aggressive clinical progression of the disease, however, sig- nals the presence of immune escape mechanisms, emphasiz- ing the complexity of tackling its immune interactions. Clinical evidence underscores the potential of immuno- therapy to enhance immune responses for effective disease control. However, the adaptive plasticity of MCC poses a challenge, as this—as already known from cytotoxic therapy approaches—enables MCC to develop early resistance to immunotherapies. Consequently, current research efforts are focused on exploring either combination therapies to coun- teract resistance and early treatment approaches, including adjuvant and neoadjuvant strategies. The rarity of MCC poses a hurdle in conducting classical clinical trials that generate substantial evidence. Acknowl- edging this limitation, there is a growing recognition of the necessity for novel trial designs that can accommodate the unique characteristics of MCC [122]. Additionally, the use of registry and real-world data trials can collect data on patients with rare molecular alterations and outcome data of various treatments, contributing to the development of evidence for these rare conditions. This shift aims to ensure the development of more effective therapeutic strategies, given the intricacies associated with the immunogenic and highly adaptive nature of MCC.

REVIEW Archives of Dermatological Research (2024) 316:244 https://doi.org/10.1007/s00403-024-03107-9 Introduction Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer, account­ ing for 75% of skin cancer deaths despite only accounting for 4% of skin cancer cases [1, 2]. Melanoma accounts for 1.7% of global cancer diagnoses, and is the fifth most preva­ lent cancer in the United States. Its prognosis is favorable if diagnosed early and surgically excised [3, 4]. Once the melanoma has reached distant metastasis, the survival rate sharply decreases with an estimated 5-year survival rate of 10% [2, 5]. Therefore, early diagnosis and intervention are crucial to patient survival. The treatments for melanoma include surgical excision, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy and intratumoral oncolytic viral therapy [2]. While these treatment modali­ ties have shown efficacy, they are accompanied by risks of scarring or systemic adverse effects. Yanci A. Algarin algariya@evms.edu 1 Eastern Virginia Medical School, Norfolk, VA, USA 2 University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Medicine, Kansas City, MO, USA 3 Florida State University College of Medicine, Tallahassee, FL, USA 4 Albany Medical College, Albany, NY, USA 5 Medical Dermatology Specialists, University of Arizona COM Phoenix, Arizona, USA 6 Department of Dermatology and Cutaneous Surgery, University of Miami Leonard M. Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL, USA Abstract Melanoma, accounting for a significant proportion of skin cancer-related deaths, has variable survival outcomes based on the stage at diagnosis and treatment efficacy. Traditional treatments, while effective, pose risks of scarring and systemic side effects. Laser therapy offers an emerging non-surgical alternative, with CO2 lasers particularly showing promise in palliative care. A comprehensive search was conducted using PubMed, focusing on laser therapy for melanoma treatment. The search included studies on both stand-alone and adjunct laser therapies, with inclusion criteria requiring peer-reviewed articles detailing treatment outcomes for primary, recurrent, or metastatic melanoma. The literature shows that laser therapy for melanoma falls into four major types when categorized by laser medium: solid-state, diode, pulse-dye, and gas (CO2). Data on solid-state lasers for melanoma are limited and their use remains controversial. However, one study with high-energy pulsed neodymium lasers reported a 5-year survival of 82.9% with minimal adverse effects for primary melanoma. CO2 laser therapy has been effective for palliative treatment, with one study showing 54.8% of patients with recurrent melanoma surviving 5.4 years post-ablation. For metastatic melanoma, numerous studies have shown that CO2 laser therapy can provide symptomatic relief and disease control. Combination therapies using lasers and immune-based therapies have demonstrated enhanced outcomes and immune activation, high­ lighting the potential of laser therapies in melanoma management. While traditional treatments remain the standard for primary melanoma, laser therapies, particularly CO2 laser ablation, show substantial promise in palliative care for metastatic melanoma. Careful patient selection and assessment are crucial for achieving positive outcomes.

Archives of Dermatological Research (2024) 316:244 Laser therapy is an emerging non-surgical alternative for the treatment of non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC). Although some laser therapies have demonstrated efficacy against pre-cancers and various NMSC, its role in mela­ noma remains controversial and unclear [6]. This review aims to assess the palliative role of lasers in managing pri­ mary, recurrent, or metastatic cutaneous melanoma. We will analyze studies that utilize laser therapy, both stand-alone and adjunctive to standard treatments, and evaluate factors such as tumor regression, recurrence rates, overall survival, and adverse effects. Methods Search strategy We performed a comprehensive search via PubMed from 1990 to 2023 by utilizing the following search terms and keywords to find relevant articles: “melanoma,” OR “cuta­ neous melanoma,” OR “melanoma in situ,” AND one of the following search terms: “laser treatment,” OR “laser ther­ apy,” OR “lasers.” The search was restricted to human stud­ ies and articles published in English. Additional references were identified from the references of relevant articles. Inclusion criteria The inclusion criteria of our study included articles pub­ lished in peer-reviewed journals that investigated the treat­ ment of melanoma with laser therapy alone or as an adjunct treatment. The articles needed to contain information regard­ ing treatment outcome, follow-up, recurrence rates, and/ or notable adverse events regarding treatment modalities. Articles that did not evaluate lasers for melanoma, lacked sufficient outcome data, and duplicates were excluded. Results Stand-alone laser therapy Melanoma Solid state lasers Limited data exists on the use of solid- state lasers for melanoma treatment. One in vitro study assessed the 755 nm alexandrite laser effects on melanoma cell lines, noting increased p16INK4a levels—a protein linked to melanoma progression—in p16INK4a-positive cells post-irradiation [7]. Such laser-induced DNA damage leading to an elevation in p16 expression is undesirable for patients with p16 mutations. Consequently, the researchers cautioned against using lasers for treating melanoma [7]. In an ex vivo study, a 694 nm Q-switched ruby laser (QSRL) was used to treat 42 biopsies from five distinct cat­ egories of melanocytic lesions: nevus cell nevi, pigmented dermal nevi, congenital nevi, lentigo maligna lesions, and superficial spreading melanomas [8]. Histology showed selective photothermolysis in pigmented and superficial cells. Lightly pigmented basal layer lesions were ablated with one QSRL treatment, but deeper, heavily pigmented lesions remained. The study advised against QSRL for melanocytic lesions due to potential risks like repigmenta­ tion, malignant transformation, or need for repeated treat­ ments, given the limited impact to basal layers and no effect on unpigmented cells [8]. Moskalik et al. retrospectively evaluated the use of two pulsed Neodymium (Nd) lasers (λ = 1060 nm, pulse dura­ tion 1 and 4.5 msec, maximum pulse energy 700 and 1000 J, respectively) for the treatment of stage I facial melanoma in 47 patients, delivering 3520–7300 J across 5–12 pulses [9]. After 5 years, the survival rate was 82.9%, with 23.4% devel­ oping regional or distant metastases. Lesions were detected in regional lymph nodes in eight (17.0%) and synchronous regional and distant metastases in three (6.4%) patients. No serious adverse effects were reported. It was concluded that high-energy pulsed Nd laser radiation is effective in treat­ ing stage I flat and/or raised melanoma lesions of 1–2 mm with Breslow thickness up to 4.0 mm and I-IV Clark levels. However, careful selection of patients for laser treatment is essential to ensure positive results [9]. While these results seem promising, there have been no other studies with the high-energy pulsed Nd laser in treating primary melanoma.

other studies with the high-energy pulsed Nd laser in treating primary melanoma. Gas - CO2 Gibson et al. evaluated the use of a Sharplan 1030 CO2 laser to treat cutaneous recurrence of melanoma [10]. Forty-two patients with recurrence of lower limb melanoma were identified, with lesions varying from 0.5 to 6 cm in diameter. The median number of lesions was 14 (range: 1–60). A total of 105 treatments were administered, with an average of 2.5 treatments per patient (range 1–9). The median duration between consecutive ablations was 5.2 months (range 1.2–72.0). Among the 42 patients, 19 (45.2%) passed away with a median survival time of 0.8 years from their initial ablation, while the remaining 23 patients (54.8%) had a median survival duration of 5.4 years since their first ablation. Notably, 10 of the 23 (43.5%) of the surviving patients remained free from disease for > 1 year. Complications were minimal with only three wounds taking longer than six weeks to heal. The researchers con­ cluded that while isolated limb perfusion remains their ini­ tial treatment of choice for recurrent limb melanoma, CO2 1 3 244 Page 2 of 11

Archives of Dermatological Research (2024) 316:244 laser ablation is a practical and use approach for palliating local recurrent melanoma [10]. Metastatic melanoma Gas - CO2 Kandamany et al. investigated CO2 laser abla­ tion for in-transit cutaneous melanoma in 16 patients with impractical surgical excision due to numerous or recurrent lesions [11]. Using a Coherent UltraPulse 3000 C CO2 laser, 559 lesions were treated. At 12 months post-treatment, 10 (62.5%) patients remained disease-free, while six (37.5%) patients developed extensive disease and succumbed, with a median survival of 1.5 years from initial ablation to death. Long-term remission was observed in six (37.5%) of patients at a median of 7.5 years from the first ablation. Minimal side effects were noted, with one case of super­ ficial cellulitis. The study supports CO2 laser ablation as a feasible initial palliative approach for melanoma metasta­ ses, highlighting its efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and mini­ mal morbidity [11]. Multiple other studies have demonstrated efficacy of CO2 laser therapy as a palliative treatment for cutaneous or regional melanoma metastases [12–17]. A series of investi­ gations utilizing various models of CO2 lasers – including the portable Sharplan 1030, Sharplan 40 C, and Sirius 300 – have treated patients with metastatic melanoma lesions, usually after isolated limb perfusion (IPL) and other treat­ ments have failed. Across these studies, a significant propor­ tion of patients achieved regional disease control, and many survived without recurrence for extended periods (Table 1). Most required fewer than five sessions in the initial year, with median survival ranging from 14 to 45 months, highlighting the potential of CO2 laser therapy in managing melanoma with minimal morbidity. Complications were rare and often related to existing comorbidities. Collectively, these stud­ ies suggest that CO2 laser therapy can be a viable primary palliative option for patients with small cutaneous satellite or in-transit lesions where surgery would cause significant morbidity. Palliation with CO2 lasers offers minimal tissue damage, simplified wound management, and favorable cos­ metic results [12–16]. In contrast to this perspective, Strobbe et al. raised con­ cerns about the suitability of CO2 laser as a first-line treat­ ment for melanoma [18]. They used the Sharplan 1030 CO2 laser at a power of 7–9 W on 15 patients with a total of 469 in-transit and satellite lesions of cutaneous melanoma. There proved to be a high incidence of recurrence in 46.7% of patients approximately one-month post-treatment. They concluded that CO2 laser treatment cannot be considered as a first-line option unless local recurrences are solved. They recommend CO2 laser ablation primarily as a palliative measure after other treatments, emphasizing surgical exci­ sion and isolated limb perfusion as initial treatments for lim­ ited and extensive limb disease, respectively [18]. The evidence suggests CO2 laser ablation is a viable option for regional disease control in patients with non- resectable satellite or in-transit metastases when surgical resection is not amenable, particularly in the palliative set­ ting. While some argue it should be attempted before IPL [15, 16], most suggest to consider it after other treatment options such as IPL or systemic therapy [12–14]. Adjunct laser therapy Melanoma Dacarbazine chemo + dinitrophenyl hapten +/- laser Chen et al. assessed the effectiveness of in situ immunotherapy using dinitrophenyl (DNP) hapten combined with laser therapy in advanced melanoma patients [19]. In the study involving 72 patients with stage lII (in-transit or satellite metastasis) or IV melanoma (distant metastasis), all receiv­ ing dacarbazine chemotherapy, the addition of laser therapy to DNP treatment resulted in improved immune response markers and survival outcomes compared to DNP alone. The combination treatment group demonstrated significant increases in

the addition of laser therapy to DNP treatment resulted in improved immune response markers and survival outcomes compared to DNP alone. The combination treatment group demonstrated significant increases in interferon-γ levels and reductions in levels of IL-10, TGF-β1, and TGF-β2, correlating with extended overall and disease-free survival. The combination therapy group showed a higher 3-year overall survival rate of 25.9% with a median survival of 28 months, versus 12.2% and 19 months for DNP monotherapy (P = 0.024). The combina­ tion also led to a 69.1% 1-year disease-free survival rate, exceeding the 44.0% rate of the monotherapy group. No severe adverse side effects were reported, but low-grade fever and fatigue were frequent complaints. The authors suggest that combining DNP with laser therapy could be a strategic approach to enhance systemic immunity and reduce metastasis in melanoma patients, thereby enhancing the survival of these patients [19]. How­ ever, the study is limited by its relatively small sample size, necessitating further validation through multicenter trials with larger populations. Metastatic melanoma Concurrent therapies + pulsed-dye laser The data avail­ able for using pulsed-dye laser (PDL) in treating metastatic melanoma are limited to case reports and series. The largest retrospective case series was published by Kottschade et al., and involved 10 patients with distant metastasis (stage IV 1 3 Page 3 of 11 244

Archives of Dermatological Research (2024) 316:244 immunotherapy in treating melanoma; however, more stud­ ies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm [22]. In-situ photoimmunotherapy + diode laser Li et al. con­ ducted a clinical trial on 11 patients with stage III and IV melanoma, administering In-Situ Photoimmunotherapy (ISPI) that combined an 805 nm diode laser, imiquimod, and indocyanine green (ICG) injections. Patients underwent one or more 6-week cycles of treatment on a 200-cm2 area. All the subjects completed at least one treatment cycle. Significant symptomatic relief in the treated regions was reported by all patients. Moreover, all treated melanoma lesions responded to ISPI, with 72.7% of patients achiev­ ing complete local response (CLR) and 54.5% showing a complete response (CR). CLR was also noted in untreated regions in some patients, suggesting systemic immune acti­ vation. The 12-month survival rate post-ISPI was 70%, with manageable side effects such as rash and pruritus being the most common. No severe toxicity was reported. ISPI, which is administered on an outpatient basis and compat­ ibility with other treatments, was favored by patients over chemotherapy for its tolerability and less detriment to their quality of life. The study concluded that ISPI using a diode laser and imiquimod is a safe and useful palliative modality for advanced melanoma [23]. Discussion Laser therapy for melanoma falls into four major types when categorized by laser medium: solid-state, diode, pulse-dye, and gas. Although, several interventions have shown prom­ ise in treating primary, recurrent, or metastatic cutaneous melanoma, CO2 laser stands as the most utilized and effec­ tive palliative treatment for melanoma. Still, methodologi­ cal variations within laser therapies often determine their success or lack thereof. In the context of stand-alone laser therapy, limited data are available on the efficacy of solid-state lasers and PDL for melanoma treatment. The Nd laser has shown prom­ ising results for stage I cutaneous melanoma, reporting a 5-year survival of 82.9% with minimal adverse effects [9]. However, other studies raised concerns about the potential impact of solid-state laser exposure on melanoma cells, par­ ticularly the sub-lethal 755 nm alexandrite laser and QSRL, and recommended against their use for melanoma treat­ ment [7, 8]. This uncertainty underscores the need for cau­ tion when selecting solid-state lasers as a primary treatment modality for melanoma. Currently, the Nd laser should not be recommended for primary melanoma, as more studies disease) [20]. These patients received PDL therapy, with or without imiquimod and/or systemic treatment. The median duration of PDL therapy was 5 months (range 2–29). Six patients (60%) experienced partial local regression, three patients (30%) had complete local regression, and one patient (10%) showed no change. Notably, five out of six patients who experienced partial local regression developed systemic disease progression. Despite varied outcomes, the study found a significant improvement in morbidity and life quality in patients treated with PDL, and recommend it as a viable and safe palliative treatment for those ineligible for additional surgical removal of skin metastases [20]. Imiquimod + pulse-dye laser Zeitouni et al. reported on an 82-year-old male patient with 50 + melanoma metastases on the right thigh and lower leg treated with combination topical imiquimod 5% and PDL [21]. Initially, he began the treatment with imiquimod 5% three times weekly. At four weeks, the frequency was increased to daily applica­ tion in conjunction with one session of 595-nm wavelength PDL (7 mm spot size, 9 J cm− 2). At week six, the lesions were visibly reduced and at eleven weeks, more than half of the lesions were resolved. The patient continued imiqui­ mod treatment for 28 weeks and received a total of 5 PDL sessions. Biopsies post-treatment confirmed no melanoma

more than half of the lesions were resolved. The patient continued imiqui­ mod treatment for 28 weeks and received a total of 5 PDL sessions. Biopsies post-treatment confirmed no melanoma presence, with a clear 6-month follow-up [21]. These results indicate the potential of PDL to enhance the anti-tumor effects of imiquimod therapy. Nevertheless, additional stud­ ies involving larger sample sizes are needed to determine the true efficacy of combination therapy with imiquimod and PDL. Ipilimumab + 805-nm diode laser Currently, there are no reports on the use of stand-alone diode lasers for the treat­ ment of metastatic melanoma. One case report involving a 65-year-old male with stage IV melanoma metastasis to his head, neck, and lungs explored the use of laser immuno­ therapy (LIT) following unresponsiveness to surgical and radiation treatments [22]. The treatment regimen included an 805-nm diode laser applied at 1 W/cm2 for 10 min across three sessions bi-weekly, complemented by twice-daily top­ ical imiquimod 5%. Post three months of LIT, the patient was administered a four-dose course of ipilimumab (3 mg/ kg) at three-week intervals, which was well-tolerated. Sub­ sequent imaging revealed resolution of two small right lung nodules and, after 9 months, resolution of a larger left lung metastasis. A year after starting ipilimumab, a PET scan confirmed the absence of lung metastases, highlighting the potential synergistic effect of LIT combined with systemic 1 3 244 Page 8 of 11

Archives of Dermatological Research (2024) 316:244 and enhanced immune responses [21, 22]. Notably, combin­ ing ISPI with an 805 nm diode laser and imiquimod demon­ strated a high rate of complete local responses (72.7%) and complete responses (54.5%) in advanced melanoma cases. The reported adverse events were generally manageable, making ISPI a relatively well-tolerated outpatient proce­ dure. These findings highlight the potential of laser thera­ pies to complement the existing approaches for managing melanoma. However, consistent with Karrera et al., we do not endorse laser therapy for primary malignant melanoma at any stage due to the insufficient evidence base. RCT with larger sample sizes are needed to further establish the role of laser therapy in managing primary melanoma. The use of lasers in melanoma treatment is not stan­ dard and is often tailored to the individual patient’s situ­ ation. The literature suggests that offering laser treatment can be a valuable option for patients with metastatic mela­ noma who are not viable surgical candidates and/or prefer a palliative approach [11, 13]. Importantly, standard treat­ ment approaches for patients with metastatic melanoma should first be considered such as intralesional injections, adjunct radiation, or immunotherapy [27]. Currently, there are no protocols and referral criteria for laser treatment in melanoma. While the National Comprehensive Cancer Net­ work’s cutaneous melanoma guidelines categorize CO2 laser ablation as a Category 2B palliative treatment, they do not provide detailed recommendations regarding the selec­ tion of CO2 laser types, nor the optimal settings and treat­ ment durations [28]. Therefore, individualized treatment planning, guided by clinical judgment and patient-specific factors, is essential for achieving positive outcomes with CO2 laser ablation in this context. Because the realistic aim of treatment is not to cure, a major benefit of laser ablation is that it can be performed with little disruption to the patient’s life. In addition, the low rate of complications associated with laser ablation makes it a viable alternative for control­ ling recurrent melanoma, offering a balance between effi­ cacy and safety. More importantly, as a palliative treatment this approach may provide patients with a higher level of comfort and extend the duration of relief from their symp­ toms. However, it is important to appreciate that laser treat­ ment is not suitable for all patients, particularly those with deep subcutaneous lesions, ulcerated lesions, and lesions larger than 2 cm [16]. The studies reviewed varied in sample size, methodol­ ogy, and patient populations, which can influence the gen­ eralizability of the results. RCT and larger-scale studies are warranted to substantiate the findings. Specifically, there is a need for more systematic investigations of adjunctive laser therapies with well-defined controls for confounding factors such as medication concentrations, photosensitizers, treatment frequency, and intervals between follow-up and with larger patient populations are needed to establish its efficacy and establish treatment protocols. No study has evaluated solid-state lasers for the treatment of metastatic melanoma. In the case of PDL, the limited data are largely based on case series for treating metastatic melanoma [20]. The results were variable, with some patients experiencing partial or complete regression of the metastatic lesions, and some no response. Most notable, however, was that major­ ity of patients treated experienced enhanced quality of life and reduced morbidity. While randomzed controlled trials (RCT) are needed to determine the true efficacy of PDL lasers for melanoma, the results show that PDL lasers with adjunct topical or systematic therapy can be a valuable pal­ liative option for patients with metastatic melanoma who cannot undergo surgical resection. However, the use of CO2 laser ablation for melanoma has shown

therapy can be a valuable pal­ liative option for patients with metastatic melanoma who cannot undergo surgical resection. However, the use of CO2 laser ablation for melanoma has shown promising results across various studies [10–17]. With regards to stand-alone treatment for recurrent mela­ noma (n = 42), 54.8% of patients had a median survival duration of 5.4 years since their first ablation. In several patients, complete remission of the disease was achieved, and ten patients were disease-free for more than 1 year [10]. Additionally, the studies on CO2 laser ablation for cutaneous metastases in melanoma patients consistently demonstrate its effectiveness as a therapeutic and palliative intervention [11–16]. Surgical resection remains the stan­ dard for managing limited satellite or in-transit melanoma metastases, but may be impractical for head and neck loca­ tions or widespread disease due to the risk of disfigurement [24–26]. In cases of advanced melanoma where surgery is not feasible, has previously failed, or is declined by the patient, CO2 laser ablation can be used for palliation or to establish regional control in select patients with unresect­ able in-transit disease [11–16]. Combining laser therapy with other treatment modali­ ties, such as immunotherapy and topicals, provides a more nuanced approach for managing melanoma. Studies have shown that several different laser and topical combina­ tions can be effective in managing primary [19] and met­ astatic melanoma [20, 22, 23]. For primary melanoma, DNP treatment combined with laser immunotherapy was the only combined treatment modality found in the litera­ ture. The combination therapy group had a significantly higher 3-year OS rate of 25.9% and a median survival of 28.0 months(P = 0.024). Additionally, the 1-year DFS in the combination therapy group was 69.1% in contrast to that of the monotherapy group at 44.0%. For metastatic melanoma, two case reports have explored the combination of laser therapy with immunomodulators, such as imiquimod [21], and immunotherapies such as ipilimumab [22]. These com­ binations showed encouraging results, with both patients experiencing complete tumor regression, symptom relief, 1 3 Page 9 of 11 244

Additionally, the long-term safety and efficacy of laser therapy in melanoma management remains uncertain, emphasizing the need for larger patient cohorts and RCT. Finally, several reports have identified melanomas being identified within lesions that had previ­ ously received laser therapy [29–34]. Thus, it is crucial to ensure that the diagnosis is biopsy-proven before pro­ ceeding with laser therapy. In addition, patients need to be informed that lasers can miss deeper-lying melanocytes and subsequent recurrences [29].

that the diagnosis is biopsy-proven before pro­ ceeding with laser therapy. In addition, patients need to be informed that lasers can miss deeper-lying melanocytes and subsequent recurrences [29]. Conclusion The role of laser therapy in the management of melanoma represents a nuanced and evolving area of dermatologic oncology. The goal of laser treatment in this context is not curative but rather palliative, aiming to minimize symp­ toms and improve the patient’s daily experience while maintaining a low complication profile. The cautious opti­ mism surrounding laser therapy is warranted; however, it is accompanied by a responsibility to ensure that patients are thoroughly educated about their options. Surgical inter­ vention remains the standard of care primary melanoma, however laser therapy can be considered for metastatic mel­ anoma for patients who are poor surgical candidates and/or prefer a palliative approach. Adjunct radiation, intralesional injections, or immunotherapy should still be considered first. Current literature reinforces the need for larger, well- designed studies to establish standardized protocols and to further evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of laser therapies in melanoma.

Methods: The specimen for the study was sent by the dermatology department for histopathology after skin biopsy. Results: Out of 42 patients, 15 patients studied were males and the rest of the cases were females. The male to female ratio was 0.55:1. Maximum (15 cases) cases were in the age group of 50–59 years. Apart from sunlight, chronic arsenic exposure is an important risk factor of BCC. Basal cell hyperplasia and squamous cell carcinoma are the histological differential diagnosis of nodular BCC and basosquamous BCC. Conclusion: BCC is a disease of the older age group and with female preponderance in our study. Nodular basal cell carcinoma was the most common histologic type of basal cell carcinoma. The face was the most common site for BCC followed by the scalp. UV radiations and Arsenic do play role in the pathogenesis of BCC. CD10 helps differentiate superficial BCC from basal cell hyperplasia.

E‑mail: drchetanjain162@gmail.com INTRODUCTION Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common malignant tumor of human beings. This occurs in the sun‑exposed areas of the skin leading to its damage. BCC is a slow‑growing tumor with very few cases of metastasis. Rarely, it could be destructive locally, if diagnosis and treatment are delayed. Clinically, morphology of lesion varies from pink colored to pearly papules with ulceration or telangiectatic vessels. The most common site of BCC is the head and neck region but can also involve trunk and extremities.[1,2] Figure 1 show BCC present on trunk. In the literature, more than 26 types of BCC are described but common clinicopathological subtypes are nodular, ulcerative, superficial, morpheaform, infiltrative, and fibroepithelial. Morphologically, single or multiple subtypes could be present in a single case. Lesions could vary from highly pigmented (dark in color) to slightly dark in color. BCC is currently treated through electrodesiccation and curettage, cryosurgery, and Mohs micrographic surgery. MATERIAL AND METHODS The present study was conducted on 42 BCC cases, consisting of ‑ patients attending the Dermatology OPD, suspected cases were submitted for histopathological examination in the Department of Pathology, Medical College, Kolkata. Histopathological diagnosis was established on routine hematoxylin and eosin staining of the section, the study period was between January 2013 to June 2014. This study aimed to identify the spectrum of histology of BCC along with clinicopathological correlation. Inclusion criteria consisted of histologically confirmed cases of BCC and exclusion criteria consisted of cases that do not How to cite this article: Jain C, Garg N, Singh S, Chattopadhyay S.

Jain, et al.: Basal cell carcinoma‑ A study of Eastern India I n d i a n J o u r n a l o f P a t h o l o g y a n d M i c r o b i o l o g y ¦ V o l u m e 6 5 ¦ I s s u e 4 ¦ O c t o b e r - D e c e m b e r 2 0 2 2 871 a family history of BCC and had early onset of BCC at an age of 30 years. The oldest patient in this study was a 78‑year‑old male. One patient had xeroderma pigmentosum and he was the second youngest case in the study (31 years). The mean and median age of patients in this study was 54.23 ± 11.74 years and 52.5 years, respectively. Out of the 42 cases, 29 cases had nodular BCC and only 1 case each of basosquamous and sclerosing BCC. Hence, the most common type of histology encountered was nodular type whereas sclerosing and basosquamous were the least common. Figures 2 and 3 illustrate the clinical appearance of Nodular BCC and Figure 4 depicts its histological picture. After nodular, the most common histology of BCC was adenoid (five cases) followed by two cases of superficial BCC. Figure 5 shows adenoid BCC in which tumor cells show glandular differentiation. The most common site was the face (21 cases, 50%), followed by the scalp (17 cases, 40.48%). If we combine cases of scalp and face regions to make it under a single category under the head region, then the total number of cases amounts to 38 (90.47%). Therefore, the most common site was the head region. Only one case (2.38%) was reported to be from the upper limb and three (7.14%) cases from the trunk. The study showed a correlation between the presence and absence of sunlight exposure in BCC cases. Patients working outdoors had plentiful exposure to sunlight. Cases working indoors had comparatively less amount of exposure to sunlight. Out of 42 cases, 23 (54.77%) had a history of direct sunlight exposure for a long duration and 19 (45.23%) cases were found, spending most of their time indoors. Table 1 demonstrates that out of 42 BCC cases 18 (42.85%) had a history of exposure to arsenic and 24 (57.15%) cases did not have exposure history. A single case of morphea had a history of arsenic exposure. Twelve out of 29 cases of nodular BCC had an exposure history. Arsenic exposure through contaminated water is quite prevalent in eastern India, therefore, determining its history is very important. Arsenic plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of BCC. In one case of basal cell hyperplasia, the expression of CD 10 was reported as negative while the expression of CD 10 was present in superficial BCC. Figure 6 shows clinical and Figure 7 show histology of superficial BCC. Similarly, baso-squamous BCC as shown in figure 8 could be a diagnostic challenge considering basoloid squmous cell carcinoma as differential. DISCUSSION BCC is a cancer of hair‑bearing skin areas, especially in the head and neck region. In some pockets of eastern India and Bangladesh region, the amount of arsenic present in water exceeds the safe level.[3] Chronic arsenic exposure is considered a risk factor of BCC. Thus, amount of BCC cases in this arsenic belt will be more as compared to other areas of the Indian subcontinent. Therefore, we took proper history for the presence of the excessive amount of arsenic in water at these places.

Jain, et al.: Basal cell carcinoma‑ A study of Eastern India I n d i a n J o u r n a l o f P a t h o l o g y a n d M i c r o b i o l o g y ¦ V o l u m e 6 5 ¦ I s s u e 4 ¦ O c t o b e r - D e c e m b e r 2 0 2 2 872 out of 42 patients, 18 (42.85%) patients were from this arsenic belt area. Cheng et al.[4] also reported thatthe BCC risk increases by 3‑4 times when drinking water is contaminated by arsenic. Therefore, we should always take a proper history of arsenic contamination in water. Clearly, more outdoor work means more exposure to UV radiations and more chances of BCC[5] In the present study, patients working outdoors were considered as subjects for chronic UV exposure, for example, farmers, building workers, fishermen, or roadside hawkers, etc., In our study, 23 (54.77%) cases out of 42 worked outdoors. The differential diagnosis for superficial BCC is basal cell hyperplasia and basosquamous BCC for squamous cell carcinoma, for which CD 10 could be used for differentiation. It was noted that the expression is present in superficial BCC and absent in basal cell hyperplasia. CD 10 expression could also be used to differentiate between trichoepithelioma and BCC. In BCC, focal positivity was seen in tumor cells whereas stromal positivity was present in trichoepithelioma.[6] Similarly, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) could be confused with basosquamous BCC. In basosquamous BCC dual population of cells are present, cells with scanty cytoplasm and cells with a relatively moderate amount of cytoplasm but in SCC cells with a similar (moderate) amount of cytoplasm are present. CONCLUSION BCC is a disease of the older age group. It affects both males and females with female preponderance in our study population. Nodular BCC was the most common histologic type. The face was the most common site for BCC followed by the scalp. Sunlight exposure and arsenic are important risk factors for BCC, especially in eastern India. CD 10 could be used to differentiate with basal cell hyperplasia. Declaration of patient consent The authors certify that they have obtained all appropriate patient consent forms.

Purpose. This work is aimed at identifying several molecular markers correlated with the diagnosis and development of basal cell carcinoma (BCC). Methods. The available microarray datasets for BCC were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, and diﬀerentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identiﬁed between BCC and healthy controls. Afterward, the functional enrichment analysis and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis of these screened DEGs were performed. An external validation for the DEG expression level was also carried out, and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to evaluate the diagnostic values of DEGs. Result. In total, ﬁve microarray datasets for BCC were downloaded and 804 DEGs (414 upregulated and 390 downregulated genes) were identiﬁed. Functional enrichment analysis showed that these genes including CYFIP2, HOXB5, EGFR, FOXN3, PTPN3, CDC20, MARCKSL1, FAS, and PTCH1 were closely correlated with the cell process and PTCH1 played central roles in the BCC signaling pathway. Moreover, EGFR was a hub gene in the PPI network. The expression changes of six genes (CYFIP2, HOXB5, FOXN3, PTPN3, MARCKSL1, and FAS) were validated by an external GSE74858 dataset analysis. Finally, ROC analysis revealed that CYFIP2, HOXB5, PTPN3, MARCKSL1, PTCH1, and CDC20 could distinguish BCC and healthy individuals. Conclusion. Nine gene signatures (CYFIP2, HOXB5, EGFR, FOXN3, PTPN3, CDC20, MARCKSL1, FAS, and PTCH1) may serve as promising targets for BCC detection and development. 1. Introduction Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is one of common malignant epi- thelial neoplasms that derive from basal cells and accounts for nearly 75% of skin cancers [1]. It was reported that the BCC incidence rates have been increasing and roughly reached 2.75 million cases around the world [2]. BCC was generally categorized into several types such as superﬁcial, nodular, and nevoid BCC on the basis of its histological and clinical characteristics. Notably, the majority of lesions for BCC occurred on the head and neck [3]. The convincing evidence has suggested that gender, age, sunlight exposure (especially ultraviolet radiation), smoking, chemicals, and fair skin were all BCC risk factors [4, 5]. Although BCC recurrence was extremely frequent due to local tissue destruction, it rarely metastasizes or leads to death [6]. The imiquimod application, surgical excision, and radiation ther- apy have been unsatisfactory for BCC treatment. Therefore, it is imperative to develop promising strategies for early diag- nosis and intervention of BCC. Fortunately, the next-generation high-throughput sequenc- ing provides fascinating opportunities for bioinformatics anal- ysis. A growing number of studies have demonstrated that gene expression proﬁling could eﬀectively screen molecular makers and predict pathogenesis for tumorigenesis in the last decades, thereby oﬀering novel therapeutic strategies for can- cer treatment [7]. Fang et al. previously found that the expres- sion level of EGR1 (early growth response 1) was decreased in BCC based on a microarray analysis. Furthermore, they also noted that EGR1 might

previously found that the expres- sion level of EGR1 (early growth response 1) was decreased in BCC based on a microarray analysis. Furthermore, they also noted that EGR1 might suppress epidermal proliferation via modulating CDC25A that is critical for cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase [8]. Heller et al. conducted a global gene expression analysis and identiﬁed BCC-associated diﬀeren- tially expressed gene (DEG) targets, providing several new diagnostic signatures for the susceptibility of BCC [9]. Later, Yunoki et al. identiﬁed three BCC-correlated genes including Hindawi BioMed Research International Volume 2020, Article ID 2073690, 10 pages https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/2073690

BCL2 (B-cell lymphoma 2), PTCH1 (Patched 1), and SOX9 (SRY-box 9) and unique gene networks involved with tumor- igenesis through a microarray analysis [10]. Additionally, Jee et al. classiﬁed BCC into squamous cell carcinoma- (SCC-) like BCC, normal-like BCC, and classical BCC subtypes by a comparative analysis of gene expression proﬁles from BCC, SCC, and normal skin tissues. Moreover, functional analysis revealed that hedgehog signaling pathways were possibly related to classical BCC development [11]. Although numer- ous investigations have extracted several BCC-related gene makers, a deeper insight into the underlying molecular mech- anisms of BCC has not been completely achieved. In this study, the eligible mRNA microarray datasets from BCC tissues were retrieved and downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Then, the DEGs between BCC and normal tissues were screened followed by functional enrichment analyses. The protein-protein (PPI) network was also constructed to explore underlying interac- tions among key genes. Finally, the expression levels of DEGs were further examined by an external dataset, and diagnostic performance of these genes were also evaluated. This work provided novel gene signatures for BCC diagnosis and pro- moted a deeper understanding for BCC progression. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Data Acquisition. The publicly accessible microarray datasets in BCC were searched and downloaded from the NCBI-GEO [12] database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ geo/). The keyword terms of carcinoma, basal cell (MeSH Terms) OR basal cell carcinoma (All Fields) AND “Homo sapiens” (porgn) AND “gse” (Filter) were used for precise searching. The inclusive criteria for datasets were as follows: (i) the datasets were gene expression proﬁles, (ii) the data was obtained from tumor tissues of patients with BCC or normal skin tissues from healthy individuals (normal con- trols), and (iii) the patients did not receive medication or other treatments. Finally, ﬁve datasets (GSE103439, GSE53462, GSE42109, GSE39612, and GSE7553) were cho- sen according to the abovementioned screening criteria as shown in Table 1. Of these, four datasets (GSE103439, GSE42109, GSE39612, and GSE7553) were generated by the GPL570 [HG-U133_Plus_2] Aﬀymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array platform, and the platform for GSE53462 was GPL10558 Illumina Human HT-12 V4.0 expression beadchip. These datasets would be used for the following integrated analyses, which consisted of 48 BCC tis- sues and 85 normal tissue samples. 2.2. Identiﬁcation of Diﬀerentially Expressed Genes (DEGs). A meta-analysis of ﬁve microarray datasets from diﬀerent plat- forms was carried out according to the guidelines provided by Ramasamy et al. [13]. The preprocessing of raw data across diﬀerent platforms, mainly including background cor- rection, normalization, log2 transformation, and gene expres- sion calculation, was performed. The overlapped genes in ﬁve datasets were selected. Then, the R metaMA package was used to calculate eﬀect sizes from unpaired data by either classical or moderated t-tests (Limma) for each study and combine these eﬀect sizes [14]. The DEGs between BCC and normal controls were screened according to the thresh- old of the multiple comparison correction false discovery rate ðFDRÞ < 0:05. The whole R sentences for data processing and identiﬁcation of DEGs in this study were shown in Sup- plementary Materials (available here). Finally, the hierarchi- cal clustering analysis of identiﬁed DEGs was performed by the pheatmap package (https://cran.r-project.org/package= pheatmap) in R language. 2.3. Gene Ontology (GO) and Pathway Enrichment Analyses. To explore the possible biological roles of the DEGs, the functional analyses were conducted. Firstly, the GO analysis involving three categories of molecular function (MF), cellu- lar component (CC), and biological process (BP) was con- ducted with BiNGO

the functional analyses were conducted. Firstly, the GO analysis involving three categories of molecular function (MF), cellu- lar component (CC), and biological process (BP) was con- ducted with BiNGO plugin in cytoscape software [15]. The parameters were set as follows: (i) hypergeometric test was used as the selected statistical test; (ii) Benjamini and Hoch- berg FDR correction was set as selected correction; (iii) selected signiﬁcance level was 0.05; and (iv) for testing option, we used whole annotation as the reference set. In addition, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis was undertaken using KOBAS (http://kobas.cbi.pku.edu.cn/index.php), which is a web- accessible tool and could identify enriched pathways for an input set of genes by mapping to genes using known Table 1: The microarray datasets for basal cell carcinoma.

pathways in the KEGG database [16]. Moreover, the statisti- cally signiﬁcantly enriched pathways were selected with the cutoﬀof P value < 0.05. 2.4. Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) Network. The Biologi- cal General Repository for Interaction Datasets (BioGRID) database is available online and provides 1,728,498 biological PPI interactions by August 2019. Here, we performed a PPI analysis for screened DEGs based on this database to identify signiﬁcant protein pairs. The cytoscape software (http://apps .cytoscape.org/apps/cytonca) was utilized to construct the PPI network. Moreover, the CytoNCA [17] (http://apps .cytoscape.org/apps/cytonca), a cytoscape plugin, was used to analyze topological characteristics of PPI nodes using the without weight parameter. Several metrics such as Degree Centrality (DC), Betweenness centrality (BC), and Closeness centrality (CC) were estimated. In this study, hub protein was determined on the basis of high scores. In addition, the MCODE plugin (http://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/mcode) in cytoscape software was employed to further identify several PPI submodules using the default parameters of degree cutoff = 2, node score cutoff = 0:2, K‐core = 2, and max: depth = 100 [18]. Notably, the PPI score > 3 was considered as the cutoﬀfor screening signiﬁcantly enriched functional modules from the PPI network. 2.5. Validation of DEG Expression Levels by a Noncoding RNA Expression Proﬁle. The GSE74858 dataset, including 3 BCC patients and 3 healthy individuals, was obtained from the GEO database and used as a veriﬁcation dataset to evaluate the expression levels of DEGs. Furthermore, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was also carried out to assess the performance of DEGs in this research using the “pROC” package (https://cran.r-project .org/web/packages/pROC/index.html) in R language. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was then computed. Herein, if AUC values of the genes were greater than 0.9, these genes were considered to discriminate patients undergoing BCC from healthy controls with high speciﬁc- ity and sensitivity. 3. Results 3.1. DEG Screening. The meta-analysis of ﬁve gene expression proﬁles was conducted, and the DEGs were identiﬁed. Con- sequently, a total of 804 DEGs were extracted between BCC and normal controls according to screening criteria described in Materials and Methods. Of these, there were 414 upregulated genes and 390 downregulated genes in patients with BCC. Moreover, the clustering analysis of these DEGs indicated that they could clearly distinguish BCC and healthy controls as exhibited in Figure 1, suggesting that the diﬀerential gene expression was possibly responsible for BCC occurrence. 3.2. Functional Enrichment Analyses of DEGs. As shown in Table 2, the GO functional annotation analysis showed that identiﬁed DEGs were enriched in 53 GO-BP terms including cellular component organization, cell cycle, cell proliferation, and ectoderm development. Meanwhile, they were focused on 54 GO-CC terms such as intracellular part, intracellu- lar, and cytoplasm. It was also observed that there were three GO-MF terms (protein binding, binding, and ribo- nuclease H activity). Notably, numerous genes were closely associated with the cellular process, including CYFIP2 (cytoplasmic FMR1 interacting protein 2; upregulated), HOXB5 (homeobox B5; downregulated), EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor; downregulated), FOXN3 (forkhead box N3; upregulated), PTPN3 (protein tyrosine phospha- tase nonreceptor type 3; downregulated), CDC20 (cell divi- sion cycle 20; upregulated), MARCKSL1 (myristoylated alanine rich protein kinase C substrate like 1; upregulated), FAS (fas cell surface death receptor; downregulated), and upregulated PTCH1. More speciﬁcally, FOXN3, CDC20, and EGFR played essential roles in the cell cycle process, and PTCH1 and EGFR were involved in cell proliferation. Additionally, KEGG pathway enrichment analysis revealed that these genes were primarily enriched in

roles in the cell cycle process, and PTCH1 and EGFR were involved in cell proliferation. Additionally, KEGG pathway enrichment analysis revealed that these genes were primarily enriched in pathways in cancer, p53 signaling pathway and BCC pathway. We also noted that PTCH1 exerted critical biological roles in the BCC pathway (Figure 2). 3.3. PPI Analysis. PPI network analysis was conducted to explore the underlying interactions of DEGs. In total, 549 gene nodes (296 upregulated genes and 254 downregulated genes) and 1462 protein pairs were obtained in the PPI net- work (Figure 3(a)). The top 5 gene nodes with a high degree were EGLN3 (Egl-9 family hypoxia inducible factor 3; degree = 82), XPO1 (exportin 1; degree = 81), EGFR (degree = 77), CFTR (CF transmembrane conductance regu- lator; degree = 48), and MCM2 (minichromosome mainte- nance complex component 2; degree = 47), and they were regarded as hub genes. Furthermore, the PPI submodule analysis suggested that 3 signiﬁcantly enriched submodules Label Label Normal skin Basal cell carcinoma −3 −2 −1 0 1 2 3 Figure 1: The heatmap of diﬀerentially expressed genes in basal cell carcinoma.

were identiﬁed based on the PPI score > 3 (Figures 3(b)– 3(d)). Interestingly, we found that the genes in submodule 1 were all upregulated. 3.4. Veriﬁcation of DEG Expression Levels and ROC Analysis. A noncoding RNA proﬁle GSE74858 was down- loaded from the GEO repository, and there were 145 over- lapped genes between this dataset and the integrated datasets. We found that 25 overlapped genes exhibited sig- niﬁcant diﬀerential expression, and their expression trends were also consistent with our integration analysis. More nota- bly, six genes (CYFIP2, HOXB5, FOXN3, PTPN3, MARCKSL1, and FAS) were predominately correlated with the cellular bio- logical process, and their expression patterns were validated by an external GSE74858 dataset (Figure 4). Besides, the ROC curve analysis was conducted to assess the diagnostic values of DEGs in BCC by ﬁve microarray datasets. There were 439 genes according to AUC > 0:9, and 129 genes were overlapped with DEGs by integrated analysis and then extracted. Our ﬁndings revealed that CYFIP2 (AUC = 0:949), HOXB5 (AUC = 0:908), PTPN3 (AUC = 0:952), MARCKSL1 (AUC = 0:962), PTCH1 (AUC = 0:981), and CDC20 (AUC = 0:956) could signiﬁcantly distinguish BCC samples and healthy controls, implying that these genes might serve as diagnostic makers for BCC detec- tion (Figure 5). 4. Discussion In the present study, we performed an integrated bioinfor- matics analysis using ﬁve microarray datasets about BCC. In total, 804 DEGs (414 upregulated and 390 downregu- lated genes) were screened between BCC and normal con- trol tissues. The GO functional analysis showed that several genes, including CYFIP2, HOXB5, EGFR, FOXN3, PTPN3, CDC20, MARCKSL1, FAS, and PTCH1, primarily played pivotal roles in cellular processes. Moreover, the expression patterns of six genes (CYFIP2, HOXB5, FOXN3, PTPN3, MARCKSL1, and FAS) were validated in an exter- nal noncoding RNA dataset. Additionally, CYFIP2, HOXB5, PTPN3, MARCKSL, CDC20, and PTCH1 had superior diag- nostic values for BCC prediction. Overwhelming evidence has suggested that the patched gene (PTCH) family played vital roles in BCC induction and progression [19, 20]. A previous study highlighted that PTCH could encode a receptor for the hedgehog signaling pathway which was important for vertebrate development and tumorigenesis [21]. Undén et al. found that the expres- sion level of PTCH mRNA was overexpressed in BCC cells compared with nontumor epidermal cells, which was similar to our ﬁnding that PTCH1 was upregulated in BCC patients [22]. Interestingly, numerous researchers pointed out that approximately 90% of function mutations in PTCH1 were Table 2: The functional analyses of diﬀerentially expressed genes in BCC.

strongly related to BCC initiation and progression [23]. Gianferante et al. evaluated 18 nevoid BCC syndrome National Cancer Institute families by whole exome sequenc- ing and found that 89% of families exhibited a pathogenic PTCH1 mutation [24]. A recent investigation has reported that PTCH1 had two mutational statuses (germinal and somatic mutation). Moreover, there was a higher expression level of PTCH1 in BCC with germinal and somatic PTCH1 mutations than that only with germinal PTCH1 mutation [25]. Additionally, our functional analyses showed that PTCH1 played signiﬁcant roles in cell proliferation and BCC pathway. However, few reports investigated the detailed molecular mechanisms of the biological roles of PTCH1 on BCC cell proliferation and growth. Herein, we performed a ROC curve analysis of PTCH1, and the result indicated that this gene was capable of discriminating BCC patients and healthy controls with a relatively high AUC value (AUC = 0:981). Taken together, our ﬁndings sug- gested that PTCH1 might be involved in the pathogenesis of BCC and has a great diagnostic value for BCC detection. We found that four genes (upregulated CYFIP2 and MARCKSL1 and downregulated HOXB5 and PTPN3) were also key players in cell biological processes. Furthermore, their expression patterns were validated by the diﬀerential expression analysis based on an external dataset. Besides, these four genes could clearly diﬀerentiate BCC patients from normal controls. CYFIP2 was reported to be a direct p53 tar- get gene, and its overexpression was closely linked with the development of various cancers [26, 27]. Ling et al. analyzed p53 mutations in sporadic and hereditary BCC tumors, and genetic alterations of p53 were responsible for BCC progres- sion [28]. Later on, Huang et al. stated that p53 activation by imiquimod contributed to cell apoptosis of a skin BCC/KMC1 cell line [29]. These ﬁndings provided indirect evidence for the hypothesis that CYFIP2 participated in the pathogenic mechanism of BCC. HOXB5 is a member of the homeobox (HOX) gene B cluster and plays key roles in sev- eral cancers [30, 31]. Lee et al. suggested that HOXB5 increased cell proliferation and invasiveness in estrogen receptor- (ER-) positive breast cancer [32]. More interest- ingly, this research group also found that HOXB5 could upregulate EGFR expression and thereby promote HOXB5- driven invasion in ER-positive breast cancer [33]. In this work, we noted that EGFR was involved in cell cycle and pro- liferation and served as a pivotal hub gene in PPI analysis. Whether the HOXB5/EGFR axis participated in BCC devel- opment remains to be illuminated in the following analysis. PTPN3 (also known as PTPH1) was also reported to be strongly correlated with diverse cancers including colorectal cancer and gastric adenocarcinoma [34–36]. Furthermore, Li et al. unraveled that the PTPN3 depletion could block the degradation of EGFR, which accelerated cell proliferation and tumorigenicity in lung cancer cells [37]. The potential roles of the PTPN3/EGFR axis on BCC occurrence also need to be clariﬁed in the future. MARCKSL1 is a cytoskeletal reg- ulator and implicated with the initiation of multiple cancers [38]. Our results implied that MARCKSL1 might be a prom- ising diagnostic maker for BCC prediction.

underlying pathogenic mechanisms of the four-gene signa- ture (CYFIP2, MARCKSL1, HOXB5, and PTPN3) for BCC progression have not been expatiated. The FAS gene contains a highly conserved cytoplasmic death domain and encodes a transmembrane protein of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily. Existing evidence has shown that FAS could bind to a death ligand, FAS ligand (FASL), to induce the cell apoptotic pathway [39]. The early research indicated that FAS normally was underexpressed and even undetectable in BCC while there was a high FASL level, possibly inducing cell death and contributing to cancer- ization [40]. A later study examined the expression level of FAS/FASL in BCCs using the immunohistochemical method. The results implied that FASL was located on the cell mem- brane of keratinocytes at the basal cell layers and FAS/FASL was markedly decreased in BCC [41]. Wang et al. revealed that FAS/FASL mRNA expression and protein levels were reduced in the BCC compared to the normal skin samples and FASL immunostaining levels were strongly related to the ability of tumor invasiveness and metastasis [42]. Simi- larly, we found that there was a lower FAS expression in BCC tissues than healthy controls, which was also conﬁrmed by a bioinformatics analysis with another BCC dataset. Therefore, we speculated that FAS might be a key gene driver in BCC development. The other two genes’ (CDC20 and FOXN3) levels were increased in BCC tissues compared to normal tissues, and functional analysis showed that they were mainly involved in the cell cycle process. We also observed that CDC20 exhibited a good performance for BCC diagnosis based on a ROC analysis. Therefore, we inferred that the aberrant expression of CDC20 and FOXN3 was probably associated with BCC development. However, the inﬂuence of these two genes on BCC pathogenesis has not been fully investigated. There are still limitations in our analysis. Firstly, only one external noncoding RNA dataset GSE74858 was obtained and used to evaluate expression levels of identiﬁed DEGs due to lack of gene expression proﬁle of BCC. Notably, the expression patterns of six genes (CYFIP2, HOXB5, FOXN3, PTPN3, MARCKSL1, and FAS) were consistent with our ini- tial diﬀerential expression analysis in the training dataset. However, the expression levels of other key genes still need to be further evaluated by using a larger sample size. Sec- ondly, the corresponding experimental assays such as cell and animal experiments were not performed to validate our conclusion primarily due to lack of enough patients’ samples and limited research funding. Thirdly, the underlying molec- ular mechanism between several signaling pathways involv- ing key genes and BCC development remains to be deciphered. Fourthly, the relevant clinical characteristics are also required to be collected to assess BCC prognosis. In summary, nine gene signatures (CYFIP2, HOXB5, EGFR, FOXN3, PTPN3, CDC20, MARCKSL1, FAS, and PTCH1) may play central roles in the initiation and Basal cell carcinoma Normal skin 5.5 6.0 6.5 7.0 7.5 8.0 GSE74858 CYFIP2 p= 0.0224115966518463 Basal cell carcinoma Normal skin 9.2 9.4 9.6 9.8 10.0 GSE74858 FAS p= 0.0363963093133442 Basal cell carcinoma Normal skin 9.2 9.4 9.6 9.8 10.0 GSE74858 FAS p= 0.0363963093133442 Basal cell carcinoma Normal skin 7.0 7.5 8.0 8.5 9.0 9.5 10.0 GSE74858 MARCKSL1 p= 0.0204961661868877 Basal cell carcinoma Normal skin 7.0 7.2 7.4 7.6 7.8 8.0 8.2 8.4 GSE74858 PTPN3 p= 0.0377593208674906 Basal cell carcinoma Normal skin 8.0 8.2 8.4 8.6 8.8 9.0 9.2 GSE74858 HOXB5 p= 0.0102197391403201 Figure 4: Validation of the expression levels of six diﬀerentially expressed genes in T basal cell carcinoma based on GSE74858 dataset.

Abstract: Basosquamous carcinoma (BSC), an uncommon and aggressive nonmelanoma skin cancer exhibiting characteristics ranging from basal cell carcinoma (BCC) to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), is a subject of controversy in terms of its classiﬁcation, pathogenesis, histologic morphology, biologic behavior, prognosis, and management. This narrative review is based on an electronic search of English-language articles in PubMed that included the terms “basosquamous carcinoma” and/or “metatypical carcinoma of the skin” in their titles. The review aims to succinctly present and assess current data on the epidemiology, clinical presentation, dermoscopic, LC-OCT, and histopathologic characteristics, as well as the genetics and management of BSC, providing insight into this intriguing entity. As a conclusion, dermoscopy, deep incisional biopsies, and immunohistologic techniques should be applied in clinically suspicious lesions to achieve an early diagnosis and better prognosis of this tumor. Surgical treatments, including wide excision and Mohs’ micrographic surgery, remain the treatment of choice. Finally, Hedgehog pathway inhibitors and checkpoint inhibitors, must be thoroughly investigated with large controlled trials, since they may offer an alternative solution to irresectable or difﬁcult-to-treat locally advanced cases of basosquamous carcinoma.

Introduction Basosquamous carcinoma (BSC), also known as metatypical basal cell carcinoma, represents a subtype of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) characterized by a combination of clinical, dermoscopic, and histologic features from both basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), along with the presence of a transition zone. It is believed that BSC initially manifests as a BCC with genetic and epigenetic alterations leading to squamous differentiation through basal to squamous transition (BST). Notably, due to its local invasiveness, high

as a BCC with genetic and epigenetic alterations leading to squamous differentiation through basal to squamous transition (BST). Notably, due to its local invasiveness, high recurrence rate, and metastatic potential, BSC stands out as one of the most aggressive subtypes of BCC. In contrast to other nonmelanoma skin cancers (NMSC), controversies have emerged over the years regarding the classiﬁcation and thera- peutic management of BSC. The World Health Organization (WHO) classiﬁes BSC as basal Cells 2023, 12, 2737. https://doi.org/10.3390/cells12232737 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/cells

Cells 2023, 12, 2737 2 of 14 cell carcinomas exhibiting both carcinomatous squamous and basaloid zones in varying proportions. However, some of the literature challenges this classiﬁcation, referring to it as mixed BCC-SCC, metatypical BCC, or even a collision carcinoma. Notably, unlike other NMSC, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) does not provide speciﬁc guidelines for the management and treatment of BSC. This article aims to summarize and evaluate the most recent data from the English literature concerning the epidemiology, clinical presentation, confocal, dermoscopic, histopathologic characteristics, genetics, and management of BSC, contributing to a better understanding of this enigmatic neoplasm. 2. Materials and Methods The terms “basosquamous carcinoma” and/or “metatypical BCC”, along with sub- headings such as classiﬁcation, incidence, epidemiology, diagnostics, histology, dermoscopy, genetics, biologic behavior, and treatment, were systematically searched in English-language papers published from 1910 to 2023, utilizing the PubMed database. Inclusion criteria comprised (1) case series or case reports speciﬁcally addressing basosquamous carcinoma and (2) review studies, meta-analyses, and systematic reviews focused on basosquamous carcinoma. Exclusion criteria encompassed (1) papers written in languages other than English and (2) articles discussing basosquamous carcinoma in organs other than the skin (e.g., larynx, nasopharynx, lungs, anus, etc.). In addition, chosen pieces from the included publications were used to enhance the discussion of our review. 3. Results 3.1. Deﬁnition Beadles published the ﬁrst description of BSC in 1894, classifying it as a particular kind of rodent ulcer [1,2]. He described a lesion with characteristics of both BCC and SCC that were difﬁcult to distinguish [1,2]. Again, in 1910, McCormack wrote about carcinomas with intermixed basaloid and squamous characteristics in a wider series of rodent ulcers [2,3]. Montgomery ﬁrst introduced the term “basal squamous cell carcinoma” (BSC) to refer to 17 out of 119 carcinomas in 1928, which he believed to be in a transitional stage between basal and squamous cell carcinomas [4,5]. The origin and deﬁnition of this neoplasm perplexed pathologists for many years [6,7]. Some hypothesized that these lesions resulted from collisions between distinct primary BCC and SCCs, others suggested a BCC variant producing keratin, while some considered them as different carcinomas with characteristics of both BCC and SCC [2,8,9]. Meanwhile, BSC was alternatively labeled as “metatypical carcinomas” in certain publications [5,10,11]. A more recent and widely accepted theory posits that BSC originates from a BCC undergoing squamous differentiation due to genetic changes [7,11,12]. The World Health Organization’s (WHO) latest deﬁnition of BSC in the “WHO Classiﬁcation of Skin Carcinomas” aligns with this theory, stating that “Basosquamous carcinoma is a term used to describe basal cell carcinomas that are associated with squamous differentiation” [13]. However, despite this characterization, several studies have documented a more aggressive behavior [5,7,14]. According to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) BCC Guidelines Version 2.2024, BSCs exhibit a metastatic capability more similar to SCC than BCC [5,7,14]. Hence, clinicopathologic correlation is recommended in these cases, and patients may necessitate a distinct protocol of treatment and followup compared to BCC patients. Due to the distinct aggressive biological behavior and clinical course that sets BSC apart from other forms of BCC, some authors caution against the use of the term “metatypical basal cell carcinoma”, considering it potentially misleading [5]. 3.2. Epidemiology BCCs and SCCs are the most common NMSCs with a rising incidence in the general population, while BSC is considered a relatively rare entity [7]. To date, few studies have directly evaluated the epidemiology of

NMSCs with a rising incidence in the general population, while BSC is considered a relatively rare entity [7]. To date, few studies have directly evaluated the epidemiology of BSC, and most of these studies were small in size due to the relatively recent histological deﬁnition of this clinical entity [5,6,15].

Cells 2023, 12, 2737 3 of 14 in a previous review, the incidence of BSC varies between 1.7 and 2.7% [5]. Speciﬁcally, Shuller et al. reported an incidence of 1.2%, Martin et al. reported 1.4%, and Bowman et al. documented a 2.7% incidence in a retrospective review of cases treated with Mohs’ mi- crographic surgery [6,16,17]. In a more recent retrospective analysis, Ciazynska et al. di- agnosed 180 cases of BSC over a 20-year period (1999–2019), corresponding to 2.1% of all NMSCs [7]. However, Gualdi et al., in a prospective study covering the years 2012–2015 and including 6042 NMSCs, reported a higher rate of 4.8% for BSCs, a percentage signiﬁcantly elevated compared to previous ﬁndings [15]. Large-scale studies that enable the radical excision of the lesion with proper histological and immunohistochemical evaluation are required for a correct epidemiological analysis of BSC because the clinical diagnosis of this neoplasm is very challenging, and histological conﬁrmation is ﬁnally required. 3.3. Clinical and Demographic Characteristics The clinical appearance of BSC is notably ambiguous, with no discernible differences from a typical BCC [5,7]. In fact, a persistent nodule that eventually transforms into an ulcer represents the most characteristic clinical presentation for BSC. The most common anatomical locations are the sun-exposed areas of the head and neck, constituting 82–97% of cases, particularly affecting the perinasal region and ears [2,5–7,17–19]. While BSCs have been identiﬁed on the trunk and extremities, these occurrences are comparatively less frequent [2,5–7,17–19]. Notably, Fitzpatrick skin types I–II and high ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure are signiﬁcant risk factors for BSC development [11]. The elderly popula- tion is more susceptible to developing this neoplasm, with individuals over 70 years old accounting for 34.4% of all BSC cases with a marked male predominance [6,12,15]. 3.4. Diagnosis of Basosquamous Carcinoma Recognition of this cutaneous tumor remains challenging, and clinical diagnosis is particularly demanding due to its rarity and nonspeciﬁc presentation, often characterized by the presence of a rapidly growing ‘rust-red’ ulceration [5]. Seborrheic keratosis (SK), hyperkeratotic actinic keratosis (AK), Bowen’s disease (BD), BCC, invasive SCC, and ame- lanotic/hypomelanotic melanoma (AHM) are a few examples of conditions that must be included in the differential diagnosis [6,17,20,21]. Histopathological analysis is considered the gold standard for diagnosing Basosquamous Carcinoma (BSC). However, occasional misclassiﬁcations of BSC as Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) or Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) have been reported, frequently due to nonrepresentative biopsies of deeply located tumors. In this context, noninvasive skin imaging plays a crucial role in both improving BSC recognition and optimizing subsequent followup strategies [22–28]. 3.4.1. Dermoscopy of BSC BSC appears to exhibit dermoscopic features that overlap with both Basal Cell Car- cinoma (BCC) and invasive Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC). Detection of at least one dermoscopic criterion from both BCC and SCC categories should raise suspicion. Accord- ing to Giacomel et al. [22], the most common dermoscopic characteristics of BSC include unfocused arborizing vessels (73%), typically located at the periphery of the tumors, as well as keratin masses (73%) and whitish structureless areas (73%). Other frequently ob- served dermoscopic features encompass superﬁcial scales (68%); ulceration or blood crusts (68%); white structures like clods, circles, and lines (64%); and blue-grey blotches (59%). Only 27% of BSC cases presented pigmentation features resembling those of BCC, such as multiple brown dots and leaf-like areas. Focused arborizing vessels were detected in only 14% of BSC cases, and in each instance, they were part of a polymorphous vascular pattern [22]. Half of the tumors exhibited a polymorphous vascular pattern, comprising various

only 14% of BSC cases, and in each instance, they were part of a polymorphous vascular pattern [22]. Half of the tumors exhibited a polymorphous vascular pattern, comprising various combinations of dotted, linear irregular, and arborizing vessels. However, only one case displayed a polymorphous vascular pattern lacking arborizing vessels, featuring dotted and linear irregular vessels [22]. The study of Acay et al. [23] demonstrated that BSC is dermoscopically characterized by BCC-related polymorphous or monomorphous vascu-

Speciﬁcally, a serpentine of branched vessels was the most common vascular ﬁnding, while keratin masses, ulceration, and white structureless areas were the most common nonvascular features [23]. In a recent study, Camela et al. [24] revealed that arborizing telangiectasias (77.8%), shiny white structures (66.7%), and ulceration (62.9%) are the most frequently observed dermoscopic structures in BSC. Additionally, follicular criteria and milky red structureless regions were common dermoscopic clues, each noted in 40.7% of cases. The study also found that the percentage of BSC cases with keratin masses (29.6%) was higher than in other aggressive subtypes of Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) such as morpheaform, micronodular, inﬁltrative, and metatypical BCC [24]. 3.4.2. Line-Field Confocal Optical Coherence Tomography (LC-OCT) of BSC Line-ﬁeld confocal-OCT is a new promising technique that may support the noninva- sive recognition of BSC through the simultaneous detection of at least one BCC-associated feature and at least one SCC-associated feature. The use of LC-OCT might be helpful not only in the diagnostic setting but also in the followup surveillance for an early identiﬁcation of recurrences. However, further larger studies are needed to prove this hypothesis [26–28]. Oliveria et al. [26] identiﬁed LC-OCT criteria for BSC that included both BCC-associated and SCC-associated characteristics. Dermal lobules featuring the characteristic millefeuille pattern, dilated vessels, bright cells within the epidermis, bright cells within lobules, stromal stretching, and stromal brightness represented BCC-associated features [26,27]. Acanthosis, hyperkeratosis, disarranged epidermal architecture, broad strands, elasto- sis and glomerular vessels encompassed SCC-associated criteria. Overlapping criteria included the interruption of the dermal–epidermal junction and ulceration [28]. 3.4.3. Histopathologic Features of BSC Deep biopsy with histologic examination remains the gold standard diagnostic method for BSC. Histologically, BSC is deﬁned as a neoplasm containing three different areas: a BCC area, a SCC area, and a transition zone between them. However, there is ongoing disagreement among dermatopathologists regarding the arrangement of these zones within the lesions [2,5,11]. Most authors consider the transition zone as tissue depicting a tran- sitional stage of differentiation between BCC and SCC cells, rather than simply an area with atypical BCC cells [2,5,29]. In BSC, the BCC area consists of basaloid cells with small cytoplasm and large, uniform, and pale nuclei. Conversely, the identiﬁcation of the SCC area requires accumulations of polygonal squamous cells with abundant eosinophilic cyto- plasm, larger open nuclei with prominent nucleoli, and frequent mitosis [2,17,29,30]. These aggregates of squamous cells are either located inside the basaloid islands or, as some authors describe, adjacent to them [2,5,23,29,31,32]. The main entities to consider in the histologic differential diagnosis of BSC are a collision tumor and a keratinizing BCC. In the case of a collision tumor, the BCC and SCC areas should represent two completely separated lesions juxtaposed with no transition zone. In the case of a keratinizing BCC, there is abrupt keratinization in the center of a nodular BCC lesion without the intervening areas of recognizable squamous cells [1,2,33]. Unfortunately, incorrect histopathologic diagnosis is common, especially when only a superﬁcial biopsy is obtained. A deep punch or incisional biopsy is often required for a correct diagnosis, as the lesion may exhibit compromised features of BCC superﬁcially, with BSC features becoming evident only in deeper areas of the tumor [1,2]. 3.4.4. Immunohistologic Features of BSC While there is no speciﬁc immunohistochemical marker exclusively for BSCs, Ber- EP4, which is typically strongly positive in Basal Cell

Immunohistologic Features of BSC While there is no speciﬁc immunohistochemical marker exclusively for BSCs, Ber- EP4, which is typically strongly positive in Basal Cell Carcinomas (BCCs), and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), which stains positively in Squamous Cell Carcinomas (SCCs), have been found to be helpful in the diagnostic process [2,5,18]. Additionally, the transition zone typically exhibits a gradual decline in Ber-EP4 staining, serving as an indication of the

Cells 2023, 12, 2737 5 of 14 transition from the basaloid zone to the area with squamous differentiation [2,5,34]. It is well known, however, that poorly differentiated SCC may assume a basaloid phenotype (BSCC), complicating the histological distinction between BSC and basaloid SCC (BSCC). Webb et al. [35] demonstrated that BSCs present a diffuse staining for Ber-EP4 and MOC-31, while BSCCs are only sporadically reactive for both markers. Positive stain for UEA-1 was observed in almost all BSCCs but only in few cases of BSC showing limited and focal positivity. These data suggest that MOC-31 is a useful marker in the speciﬁed differential diagnosis, especially when used together with UEA-1 [35]. According to Haensel et al. [36], surface marker Lymphocyte Antigen 6 Family Member D (LY6D) marks and tracks basosquamous populations. They show that LY6D+ tumor cells lie on a differentiation spectrum between BCC and SCCs and labels the transition area of BSC. Regarding the immunohistochemical proﬁle among different subtypes of BCCs, Cojo- caru et al. illustrated that BSCCs exhibited higher CD31, CD34, and alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) stromal expression, suggesting a link between the tumoral microenviron- ment and the invasiveness (and consequently aggressiveness) of this entity [37]. 3.5. Genetics and Pathogenesis While the exact gene mutations causing BSC are still debated, the genetic background of BCC and SCC has been extensively examined. BCC is characterized by the excessive activation of the sonic hedgehog (HH) pathway, either through the inhibition of the trans- membrane protein PTCH or the activation of SMO [38–40]. Various genetic drivers of BCC include PTEN, MYCN, PPP6C, GRIN2A, GLI1, CSMD3, DCC, PREX2, and APC [38,41,42]. SCC is distinguished by a diverse range of gene mutations, including alterations in HRAS and disruptions of genes such as TGFBR1, TGFBR2, NOTCH1, NOTCH2, CASP8, CDKN2A, NOTCH3, KRAS, NRAS, PDK1, BAP1, AJUBA, KMT2D, MYH9, TRAF3, NSD1, CDH1, and TP63 [38,43–46]. According to Chang et al. [38], a signiﬁcant number of BSCs exhibited underlying PTCH1 and SMO mutations. Additionally, these BSCs showed mutations commonly associated with BCC, including MYCN, PPP6C, GRIN2A, CSMD3, DCC, PREX2, APC, PTEN, and PIK3CA [38]. These ﬁndings lend support to the hypothesis that the sonic hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway serves as the primary driver mutation in BSC. It is suggested that BSC likely originates as a BCC and undergoes partial differentiation into SCC through the accumulation of ARID1A mutations and activation of the RAS/MAPK pathway [38,47]. Numerous authors have proposed that the transition from basal to squamous cell carcinoma (BST) originates from epigenetic modiﬁcations [48]. The etiopathogenesis of BST remains a complex and debated matter, with potential involvement of various drivers and inducers such as SMO inhibitors (SMOi), activation of transcriptional inducers like c-FOS, and subsequent mutations such as ARID1A. Preclinical studies indicate that inhibiting SMO can prompt the shift of basal cell carcinoma to squamous cell carcinoma by promot- ing c-FOS activation of the EGFR/RAS/MAPK pathway. Conversely, inhibiting EGFR can reverse the effects of this transition [47,48]. More extensive research efforts are still required to fully understand this phenomenon. Figure 1 shows basosquamous histological, immunohistochemical, and genetic features. 3.6. Biologic Behavior and Prognosis In contrast to BCC, BSC exhibits a more aggressive biologic behavior that is nearly comparable to SCCs’ [2,5,18,30,41]. This “aggressiveness” is characterized by a more dynamic local tumor growth as well as a higher risk of recurrences and metastasis. As a consequence, these characteristics are associated with a worse prognosis as compared to the classic BCC [2,5].

Cells 2023, 12, 2737 6 of 14 Figure 1. Basosquamous histological, immunohistochemical, and genetic features. According to Volkestein et al., the local recurrence rate of BSC—after wide surgical excision—reaches 45%, which is almost double that of BCC and SCC [18]. In a different study where Mohs’ micrographic surgery was performed, the topical recurrence rate for BSC dropped to 4–9% but remained higher than BCC (0.64%) and SCC (1.2%) [2,14,42,43,49]. The metastatic potential of BSC ranges between 4 and 8.4%, which is closer to that of SCC [2,42,50,51]. Ciazynska et al. [52] reported that 40% of patients diagnosed with BSC had a second skin neoplasm. This percentage is signiﬁcantly higher than the corresponding 23% reported with other nonmelanoma skin cancers (NMSCs) and multiple lesions [7]. In this context, they concluded that BSC patients are more prone to the development of new primary skin cancers, and for this reason, they should be closely monitored [7]. 3.7. Treatment of BSC There are currently no standardized approved therapeutic guidelines for the manage- ment of BSCs. The rarity of these tumors along with the absence of robust literature data are the most reasonable explanations for the present scenario. Nevertheless, a variety of treatments have been used, with different degrees of efﬁcacy. Superﬁcial methods such as curettage and electrodesiccation have been used in the past but are not considered ﬁrst line treatment due to their high recurrence rate. A multidisciplinary team (MDT) evaluation is always recommended. 3.7.1. Wide Surgical Excision Similarly to BCC and SCC, the ﬁrst-line treatment for BCS is surgical excision, but surgical margins should be wider than those for low-risk BCC due to the inﬁltrative growth pattern of this tumor [53–60]. Favorable aesthetic outcome requires precise planning of the reconstructive technique [59]. Although a very high recurrence incidence of up to 45% has been reported after wide surgical excision, several studies [2,5,12,16–18,20,21,29,53] still rec- ommend this approach as the ﬁrst-line therapeutic option. Additionally, it is recommended that surgical excision be followed by the evaluation of lymph nodes and distant metastases, as well as, of course, close clinical followup for recurrence and metastasis [2,6,17]. 3.7.2. Mohs’ Micrographic Surgery (MMS) According to recent studies, MMS is the best surgical option for BSCs, since it is associated with a lower rate of recurrence than wide surgical excision [17,29,30,54,55]. Ana- lytically, Skaria et al. demonstrated an 8.9% recurrence rate with MMS, which is signiﬁcantly

Cells 2023, 12, 2737 7 of 14 higher when compared to the recurrence rates reported for BCCs and SCCs but signiﬁcantly lower than the 45% observed with large surgical excision [54]. Even lower recurrence rates (4.9%) were reported by Allen et al. [55]. However, in order to formally endorse MMS as the preferred ﬁrst-line treatment for BSCs, according to Oldbury et al., a number of logistical and budgetary obstacles must be resolved: (a) the inability to pre-operatively choose the ideal MMS candidates (i.e., clinical diagnosis of BSC instead of BCC) in everyday clinical practice; (b) higher costs of MMS compared to surgical excision; (c) more time-consuming process; and (d) its non-applicability in many centers worldwide [12]. 3.7.3. Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy (SLNB) The use of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy (SLNB) in the management of BSC has been recommended by some authors. However, there is ongoing controversy regarding whether SLNB should be routinely offered for BSCs to enable early diagnosis of occult nodal metastasis, staging, and treatment of subclinical node disease [17,32]. Kakagia et al. have suggested that a tumor size greater than 2 cm, along with lymphatic and perineural invasion, are signiﬁcant factors in determining SLN (Sentinel Lymph Node) micrometastasis [56]. Yoshida et al. [57] propose that SLNB might be considered for speciﬁc high-risk groups, such as patients with a BSC larger than 3 cm located on the trunk or extremities. Given that the metastatic rate of BSC is still lower than that of malignant melanoma or Merkel cell carcinoma, routine use of SLNB for BSC is not generally recommended. However, further prospective controlled studies with a longer followup are required to validate any potential beneﬁt of early SLNB for nodal spread and distant metastases [57]. 3.7.4. Radiotherapy Several authors have proposed adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) for BSC in speciﬁc scenar- ios, such as when positive surgical margins prevent re-excision of the tumor or in cases with local lymph node metastasis [2,12,17,58]. There is a suggestion that radiotherapy, either as a standalone treatment or in combination with surgery, could be a suitable option for managing BSC when standard surgical excision or Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) is not feasible [12,59,60]. This approach may be considered in situations where alterna- tive surgical options are limited, aiming to enhance local control and manage potential residual disease. The American Society of Radiation Oncology recommend consideration of post-operative RT for gross perineural spread that is clinically or radiologically appar- ent. The use of deﬁnitive RT is discouraged for the treatment of SCC or BCC in patients with genetic conditions predisposing them to intensiﬁed radiosensitivity, such as ataxia telangiectasia, nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (Gorlin syndrome), or Li–Fraumeni syndrome. Poorly controlled connective tissue disorders are a relative contraindication to treatment. For patients with BCC undergoing adjuvant RT, a dose of 6000 cGy (conven- tional fractionation [180–200 cGy/fx]) is recommended; for deﬁnitive treatment, 7000 cGy (conventional fractionation [180–200 cGy/fx]) is the standard [60]. 3.7.5. Antitumoral Drugs: Chemotherapy BSC not eligible for locoregional therapies might be evaluated by the MDT, and a strategy including target therapy, immunotherapy, and, in rare cases, chemotherapy might be suggested. The patient journey, comorbidities, age, primary and node sites, symptoms, and the prevalence of either BCC or SCC behavior must be considered. In a few cases of locally advanced and metastatic BSCs, palliative chemotherapy has been used (adriamycine, cisplatin, carboplatin, paclitaxel) [61–63]. Kanzaky et al. [61] presented a case report of metastatic BSC treated with adriamycine and cisplatin. Sheen et al. described the complete regression of an extensive and locally destructive BSC involving the nasal septum and sinuses in a patient after a 4-month

Sheen et al. described the complete regression of an extensive and locally destructive BSC involving the nasal septum and sinuses in a patient after a 4-month regimen of intra-arterial (IA) infusion of low-dose cisplatin [61].

Cells 2023, 12, 2737 8 of 14 3.7.6. Sonic Hedgehog Inhibitors (HHIs) Hedgehog inhibitors have revolutionized the treatment of BCC with impressive out- comes. However, few data are available for BSC, and there is controversy in the MDT about whether BSC should be treated as SCC with ﬁrst-line immunotherapy or as BCC with ﬁrst-line HHIs. Vismodegib and sonidegib are HHIs approved for the treatment of adults with metastatic BCC or locally advanced BCC that has recurred after surgery or adults who are not candidates for surgery or radiation. According to the available literature data, the risk of developing SCC in individuals treated with vismodegib is controversial [64–68]. Considering that BSC pathologically exhibits features of both BCC and SCC, treatment with vismodegib might bear the risk of progression of the SCC component of the tumor. Indeed, reports have been published on the development of SCC in patients treated with vismodegib, and a case-control study of 180 patients found an increased risk of SCC in patients treated with vismodegib [64]. On the other hand, the largest published cohort study of 1675 patients suggests that vismodegib is not associated with an increased risk of developing SCC, while a systematic and a narrative review of the literature concluded that the available evidence does not justify an association between vismodegib and the development of SCC [68,69]. In addition, there are very recent case reports involving a total of ﬁve patients that provide preliminary evidence that vismodegib may be effective in difﬁcult-to-treat BSC (Table 1) [69–71]. In all cases, the lesions did not “transform” into pure squamous cell tumors but, on the contrary, regressed completely, and in two cases remission was maintained over a very long period [69–71]. Despite these positive data, in one case of basosquamous carcinoma treated with vismodegib, the drug had to be discontinued due to adverse effects before its efﬁcacy could be evaluated [72]. In this sense, a post hoc analysis described the time to onset and severity of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in patients treated with the two HHIs. The results suggest a delayed onset of many common TEAEs and a lower incidence of muscle cramps, alopecia, and dysgeusia in patients treated with sonidegib 200 mg compared to vismodegib 150 mg [73]. Sonidegib is approved for the treatment of adult patients with recurrent locally ad- vanced BCC who are not candidates for surgery or radiotherapy. The pivotal BOLT study (NCT01327053) [74,75] is an international, randomised, and double-blind phase 2 study that evaluated the long-term efﬁcacy of sonidegib 200 and 800 mg once daily in all histological subtypes of BCC after 42 months. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR) [74,75]. A total of 230 patients were included; 36 (15.7%) with metastatic BCC and 194 (84.3%) with locally advanced BCC (aggressive, 112 of 194 [57.7%]; nonaggressive, 82 of 194 [42.3%]). The ORR at 42 months for patients with aggressive and nonaggressive locally advanced BCC was 59.5% (22 of 37) and 51.7% (15 of 29) for 200 mg [74,75], respectively. Approximately 50% of patients with nonaggressive subtypes in each group achieved an objective response [75]. The median time to response (TTR) for patients with an inﬁltrative subtype was 4.7 months (95% conﬁdence interval, 1.9–6.6 months) for sonidegib 200 mg [75]. Recent studies [76,77] demonstrate the efﬁcacy and safety of sonidegib in the treatment of BSC. The aggressive biological behavior and clinical course distinguish basosquamous carcinoma from other forms of BCC. In view of the greater risk of postoperative recurrence, some authors have recently investigated the neoadjuvant approach. Prof E. Dika [77] reported a clinical case of BSC on the scalp and zygomatic region treated with sonidegib at a dose of 200 mg daily in a neoadjuvant setting. After 8 months, the patient showed complete response of all lesions, and the MTB decided to

region treated with sonidegib at a dose of 200 mg daily in a neoadjuvant setting. After 8 months, the patient showed complete response of all lesions, and the MTB decided to proceed with excisional biopsy of the remaining zygomatic lesion. Although the effect of HHIs on BSC treatment requires further investigation in larger controlled trials, HHIs such as vismodegib and sonidegib may represent a safe and effective ﬁrst line treatment [78]. 3.7.7. Checkpoint Inhibitors Immune checkpoint inhibitors, speciﬁcally anti-CTLA4, anti-PD1, and anti-PDL-1 antibodies, are commonly used to treat skin cancers, including melanoma, SCC, BCC, and

Cells 2023, 12, 2737 9 of 14 Merkel cell carcinoma. These tumors and BCC have similarly high rates of malignant mutations and T cell inﬁltration. In cases of locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic SCC where options for locoregional treatment are limited, the recommended therapeutic approach is the use of anti-PD1 cemiplimab, especially in patients who have exhausted other treatment options. For locally advanced BCC (laBCC), cemiplimab serves as a second- line treatment when curative surgery or radiation is not viable. This is applicable to patients who have experienced progression on hedgehog pathway inhibitors (HHIs), are intolerant to HHI therapy, or have not objectively responded after months of HHI therapy. Studies on cemiplimab have demonstrated a favorable effectiveness and tolerability proﬁle, albeit with a shorter average length of response compared to SCC [71,79–81]. In a Phase II study led by Stratigos in 2021, which involved 84 patients experiencing progression on hedgehog inhibitors (HHI), 31% of patients achieved an objective response rate, with 6% of those responses being complete [81]. Subsequent studies conﬁrmed the positive effectiveness and tolerability proﬁle of cemiplimab, although the duration of response in BCC was observed to be shorter than in SCC. In a real-world retrospective analysis of cemiplimab in locally advanced SCC, among 25 patients, 52% demonstrated an objective response (3 complete and 10 partial responses), with 76% achieving disease control [82]. In a multicenter retrospective study by GK et al., involving 29 patients with locally advanced or metastatic BCC, an overall response rate (ORR) of 31% was observed in metastatic BCC and 69% in locally advanced BCC [83]. Cemiplimab also offers an alternative for patients with BSC resistant or intolerant to hedgehog inhibitors (HHI). Given the intricate pathobiology of BSC, there is interest in targeting both components, involving tumor immune dysregulation and abnormal activation of hedgehog signaling. Patel et al. reported the beneﬁt of cemiplimab ± HHIs in 16 patients [84]. Colombo et al. documented two cases of advanced synchronous BCC/cSCC of the head and neck treated with combined therapy using cemiplimab and sonidegib, achieving signiﬁcant clinical beneﬁt and long- term responses without major adverse events [85]. Other treatments options such as the PD-L1 inhibitors pembrolizumab and nivolumab have been used for the treatment of advanced-metastatic BCCs and SCCs, but there are few literature data for their use in advanced BSC [72,73,81]. Table 2 shows three case reports presenting locally advanced and metastatic BSC treated with checkpoint inhibitors.

Cells 2023, 12, 2737 11 of 14 4. Conclusions Basaloid squamous cell carcinoma (BSC), a contentious entity within nonmelanoma skin cancers, shares features with both basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) at clinical, dermoscopical, confocal, and histological evaluation. Clinical examination alone cannot distinguish BSC from BCC, but dermoscopy and LC-OCT offer potential for more accurate diagnosis by revealing characteristics invisible to the naked eye. Deﬁnitive diagnosis relies on histology, often aided by deep incisional biopsies and immunohistochemistry, particularly Ber-EP4 staining. The absence of standardized treatment protocols for BSC necessitates prospective studies comparing various options to establish a consensus on ideal management. Surgical approaches, notably wide excision and Mohs’ micrographic surgery, are favored by many clinicians. Controversies persist around the use of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), radiation therapy, and imaging monitoring, especially in cases with suspicious features like a tumor size exceeding 2 cm or evidence of perineural and lymphatic invasion. Radiotherapy could have a supportive role, postoperatively, when re-excision is not possible or not allowed by the patient. Finally, new treatment prospective with sonic hedgehog inhibitors and checkpoint inhibitors must be thoroughly investigated, with large controlled trials, since it may offer an alternative solution to irresectable or difﬁcult-to-treat locally advanced cases of BSC.

Although this condition’s gold-standard treatment is the surgical removal of the lesions, the physician must propose alternative treatments in some cases due to the patient’s ineligibility for surgery. Among the available alternative therapies, local chemotherapy may represent an initial treatment in combination with radiotherapy or systemic chemotherapy due to the low frequency of side-effects and the lack of necessity for expensive devices. Methods: In this paper, we review all available literature in various databases (PubMed, Scopus-Embase, Web of Science), proposing local chemotherapy as a treatment for cutaneous and oral SCC. Exclusion criteria included ocular lesions (where topical treatments are common), non-English language, and non-human studies. Results: We included 14 studies in this review. The majority were case reports and case series describing the treatment of non-resectable localized SCC with either imiquimod or 5-ﬂuorouracil. We also analyzed small studies proposing combination treatments. Almost all studies reported an excellent clinical outcome, with a low risk of relapses in time. Conclusions: Resection of the lesion remains the gold-standard treatment for SCC. When this approach is not feasible, local chemotherapy may represent a treatment alternative, and it may also be associated with radiotherapy or systemic chemotherapy. Keywords: squamous cell carcinoma; imiquimod; 5-ﬂuorouracil 1. Introduction Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors affecting the skin. The abnormal and quick growth of keratinocytes in the epidermis, often secondary to ultraviolet or sunlight exposure, is a characteristic of this cancer [1–3]. SCC involving the head and neck area may be particularly aggressive. Oral SCC accounts for 90% of all oral malignancies [4]. Due to its ability to metastasize, the gold-standard treatment for SCC is surgery. Some authors suggest performing surgical enlargement of the margins and radiological investigations based on the histopathologic ﬁndings [5–7]. However, surgical removal is not always possible for various reasons (patient ineligible for surgery, refusal of the procedure, particular areas involved, etc.) [8,9]. Clinicians usually offer an alternative treatment in these cases, such

possible for various reasons (patient ineligible for surgery, refusal of the procedure, particular areas involved, etc.) [8,9]. Clinicians usually offer an alternative treatment in these cases, such as radiation therapy or systemic chemotherapy [10,11]. Physicians may propose topical chemotherapy as an adjuvant therapy combined with other medications or, in localized in situ tumors surrounded by precancerous areas, as a primary treatment. Various topical drugs have been proposed to manage SCC, the same used for topical treatment of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and precancerous actinic keratosis Curr.

Curr. Oncol. 2021, 28 2318 (AK) [12]. In this paper, we review all proposed topical treatments for SCC and highlight the possible therapeutic combinations available. 2. Materials and Methods The authors followed criteria established in the Preferred Reporting Items for System- atic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for this review [13]. 2.1. PICO Question Is topical therapy effective, in selected cases, as an alternative treatment for unre- sectable squamous cell carcinoma? 2.2. Search Strategy Two independent researchers (L.B. and F.B.) performed a systematic review in three different databases (PubMed/Medline, Google Scholar, Scopus/Embase). Articles pub- lished up to 7 March 2021, were included. The keywords used were “topical” AND “skin cancer”, “squamous cell carcinoma”, “squamous carcinoma”, “spinous cell carcinoma”. All articles’ titles and abstracts were screened. 2.3. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria Articles involving ocular lesions (in these kinds of lesions, the surgical approach is usually postponed), reporting the use of photodynamic therapy or the presence of internal malignancies, and non-human clinical studies were excluded. Articles published before January 2000 or published in languages different than English were also included. In case of discrepancies between the researchers, a third physician (E.P.) had the ﬁnal word on inclusion or exclusion of the paper (Figure 1). Figure 1. PRISMA ﬂow chart for study selection.

Curr. Oncol. 2021, 28 2319 2.4. Statistical Analysis Means, percentages, and Fisher’s exact test used within the text to assess statistical signiﬁcance were all performed using SPSS Statistics version 27.0 (IBM, Armonk, New York, NY, USA). 3. Results The results of the literature search are reported in the PRISMA ﬂow diagram (Figure 1). A total of 14 papers were selected: eight case reports, four case series, and two prospective studies. Forty-nine patients were included in the review (mean age: 70.5 years old). Researchers treated 12 patients with imiquimod 5% (11 cases) or 3.75% (one case), 15 patients with 0.1 % tazarotene, and 25 patients with 5% 5-ﬂuorouracil (four subjects were simultaneously treated with imiquimod and 5-ﬂuorouracil). Researchers treated a patient with 80% trichloroacetic acid following intralesional administration of 5-ﬂuorouracil. Inves- tigators reported a complete response rate with SCC clinical and histological disappearance in 47% of lesions treated with 0.1% tazarotene, in 92% of patients treated with imiquimod, and in 96% of patients treated with 5-ﬂuorouracil. However, given the high number of case series and case reports included in this review, the actual response rate of imiquimod and 5-ﬂuorouracil may be much lower. The follow-up period was very variable among reported studies, ranging from 4 years to no follow-up at all. However, out of 49 patients, only a single relapse was reported 9 months after combination treatment with fractional ablative laser and 5-ﬂuorouracil. Researchers used combination treatments in 22 out of 49 patients, managing SCC with fractional lasers and 5% 5-ﬂuorouracil (17/22), with 5% 5-ﬂuorouracil in the morning and 5% imiquimod at night (4/22), and with intralesional 5% 5-ﬂuorouracil and 80% topical trichloroacetic acid (1/22). Topical combination therapies showed a response in 95% of cases, while monotherapies reported a 67% response rate, suggesting that sequential topical treatments may be more effective than single therapies alone (p = 0.02). The results derived from the data analysis of the studies are summarized in Table 1. Table 1. Data analysis from the studies.

Discussion Due to the low risk of systemic side-effects and the selective application in the area involved, topical therapies in dermatology are the most used in managing diseases [14]. Malignant tumors, however, due to their invasiveness and the risk of metastasis, are treated with surgery, and alternative therapies are only considered if the patient is not eligible or refuses the operation [15]. Our analysis of the medical literature reports that, to manage SCC, topical treatments are never used sequentially after surgery but as an alternative alone or in combination with other less invasive techniques, such as fractional lasers or intralesional injections. In these rare cases, the drugs used are mainly imiquimod and 5-ﬂuorouracil.

Curr. Oncol. 2021, 28 2320 Imiquimod is an immune response modiﬁer that activates Toll-like receptor 7 and stimulates cytokines such as interferon-α, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α. To generate an inﬂammatory response, this drug may activate different cells, such as natural killer cells, macrophages, B-lymphocytes, and Langerhans cells [16,17]. Imiquimod is used to treat various conditions, such as actinic keratosis, BCC, viral warts, condyloma acuminata, and molluscum contagiosum [18,19]. Various papers report the use of imiquimod in treating SCC. The main beneﬁt of this drug seems to be a good response rate, while it may be associated with a higher risk of irritation and it may be more expensive than the other drugs. Imiquimod has been proposed for the treatment of oral SCC with good results [20]. Furthermore, various case reports reported the use of imiquimod in immunocompromised and very old patients with optimal results [21–23]. This drug was proposed at 5% and 3.75% concentration [24]. Hearing loss was reported in one of the included studies as a side-effect [25]. Ondo et al. reported a case series of cutaneous SCC involving the digital areas. All patients failed topical monotherapy with imiquimod 5% and 5-ﬂuorouracil 5%. The combination of both treatments (5-ﬂuorouracil in the morning and imiquimod in the evening) led in 6–8 weeks to a robust inﬂammatory response, with the complete resolution of the clinical condition in all patients [26]. 5-Fluorouracil is a chemotherapeutic agent that acts by blocking the thymidylate synthase and subsequently DNA production. The drug is parenterally administered to manage various neoplasms, such as colon, esophageal, stomach, pancreatic, breast, and cervical cancer. Its topical formulation is used for the management of precancerosis, BCC, and warts. Different authors have reported experiences in the treatment of SCC [27,28]. The main beneﬁts of this drug are the high response rate and the fact that it is relatively cheaper than the other topical alternatives. This medication, however, is not commercially available in all countries; thus, galenic formulations in local drug stores/laboratories may not always guarantee high quality. This drug has been proposed to treat in situ SCC of the eyelid with good results and no relapse during a 3 year follow-up [29]. Various studies proposed a combination of fractional carbon dioxide laser and 5% 5-ﬂuorouracil under occlusion to enhance drug penetration, with a substantial reduction of the tumor mass [30]. Nguyen et al. proposed the treatment of superﬁcial BCC and SCC with combination therapy of ablative fractional carbon dioxide laser and the subsequent topical application of 5% 5-ﬂuorouracil under occlusion for 7 days, exploiting the cutaneous pores generated by the laser to enhance drug penetration in the skin [31]. The CO2 laser, due to its 10,600 nm wavelength, acts by selectively heating water and causing thermal destruction of the tissue [32,33]. The fractional CO2 laser can create thermal microchannels that have the goal of conveying the drug to the dermis and guaranteeing a better penetration in the area [34]. All resulting scars were histologically examined, showing a complete clearance of SCC (16 out of 16 lesions treated) and a good clearance of BCCs (10 out of 14) [35]. A subsequent follow-up study started to assess the risk of relapses after laser-assisted drug delivery of 5% 5-ﬂuorouracil. Only 20 out of the 28 original participants of the study were recruited, and, in the 12 out of 14 SCC patients followed, only one lesion relapsed after 9 months of follow-up [36].

of follow-up [37]. Another group also reported a 67 year old woman that developed three SCCs after starting treatment with vemurafenib for cutaneous melanoma. Seven weeks of topical treatment with 5% 5-ﬂuorouracil led to the disappearance of the lesions [38]. Vazquez et al. reported a 96 year old patient affected by a localized SCC treated with intralesional injection of 1.5 mL of 5% 5-ﬂuorouracil and then a single layer application of 80% trichloroacetic acid. After 3 weeks, another single application of 80% trichloroacetic acid was sufﬁcient to guarantee the clinical resolution of the lesion [39].

Curr. Oncol. 2021, 28 2321 Various groups reported the occurrence of SCC after the application of topicals. A group reported the appearance of SCC in the mouth after the use of tacrolimus to treat oral lichen planus, although it is not clear if the insurgence of SCC was subsequent to lichen evolution or to drug application [40]. Tazarotene is a third-generation topical retinoid, a compound derived from vitamin A, used mainly to treat acne and psoriasis [41,42]. Although the drug seems to be reasonably effective, the high risk of irritation, together with the low number of experiences reported in medical literature, may preclude its use. An Italian group reported the use of daily applications of topical tazarotene for 6 months in 15 patients affected by cutaneous SSC (nine men and six women, mean age 73 years old) affecting various areas of the body (seven cases of the extremities, six of the trunk, and two of the head). Five of them were excluded during the study for various reasons, three obtained a partial remission, and only seven showed a complete histologically conﬁrmed response [43]. All studies included in this review are summarized in Table 2. Table 2. Studies included in the review. Name of the Study Type of the Study Patients Characteristics Topical Drug Used Outcome Wester et al., 2017 [20] Case report 87 year old female, oral SCC refractory to surgery and radiotherapy Imiquimod 5% once a day for 2 weeks, and then once a week No recurrence of the tumor after 4 years of continuous treatment Hengge et al., 2004 [21] Case report 65 year old male SCC of the hair rim histologically conﬁrmed with a biopsy Imiquimod 5% 3 times per week overnight for 16 weeks At week 16, biopsy of the area showed no sign of SCC Oster-Schmidt, 2004 [22] Case series 88year old and 92 year old women with SCC respectively of the right ear and right upper leg in poor systemic conditions.

A Japanese group studied the effectiveness of a topical ointment with microRNA (miRNA) 634 combined with a systemic EGFR inhibitor in vitro and then in vivo on mice. If the ﬁndings of this study are conﬁrmed in human studies, this combination therapy may become an alternative for cutaneous SCC ineligible for surgery [44]. Smith et al. treated 10 patients affected by SCC bigger than 3 cm in diameter with imiquimod three times per week for 2 weeks before surgery. A small biopsy specimen was taken from the area before starting the topical treatment. Both the biopsy and the surgical piece were histologically and immunohistochemically stained, showing an increase in the

Curr. Oncol. 2021, 28 2323 inﬂammatory inﬁltrate, with a decrease in macrophages and a T helper 1 response after topical drug therapy [45]. Different neoadjuvant treatments have been proposed to manage SCC. To our knowl- edge, none of these drugs has been used as a topical treatment, but all are administered in systemic form, and they include cemiplimab, pembrolizumab, cisplatin, bleomycin, and 5-ﬂuorouracil [46]. Lastly, 5% imiquimod has been proposed as an adjuvant treatment after surgery in a SCC of the lip, with no relapse of the condition after 2 years. A prospective trial with a high number of patients will be necessary to conﬁrm the effectiveness of this approach [47]. 5. Conclusions The gold-standard treatment for the management of skin and oral mucosal SCCs is complete surgical resection and, when surgery is not possible, chemotherapy and radio- therapy must be considered. In selected cases where neither of these options is available, topical drugs may represent a valid alternative due to patients’ comorbidities or refusal of aggressive treatments. If SCCs do not show aggressive behavior, if they are localized and small-sized, and if metastasis or nodal involvement is not present, this type of treatment may be considered. Among the various drugs proposed in the medical literature, 5% 5-ﬂuorouracil seems to have a better clearance rate than imiquimod and tazarotene. How- ever, most data were derived from case studies; hence, drug effectiveness may be lower than reported, as negative experimental results are more rarely published in literature. Further and more extensive clinical trials will be necessary to conﬁrm the results of this review and prove the effectiveness of topicals in managing cutaneous and oral SCCs, as the low number of prospective trials present in literature does not allow drawing any ﬁnal conclusions Author Contributions: Conceptualization, L.B. and F.B.; methodology, L.B. and C.P.; formal analysis, L.B., F.B. and S.P.N.; investigation, L.B. and P.M.; data curation, L.B. and M.P.; writing—original draft preparation, L.B., F.B., S.D. and E.P.; writing—review and editing, L.B. and S.P.N.; visualization, P.M.; supervision, A.G., C.P. and S.P.N.

Optimal care of this potentially life-threatening cancer is critical but challenging because: physicians are often unfamiliar with its management due to rarity, and MCC management re- mains controversial, in part because it is rapidly evolving across multiple specialties. While guidelines offer a broad overview of management, they are often not sufficient when making decisions for individual pa- tients. Herein, we present a literature review as well as practical approaches adopted at our institutions for staging, surveillance and therapy of MCC. Each of these areas are discussed in light of how they can be appropriately customized for prevalent but challenging situations. We also provide representative exam- ples of MCC patient scenarios and how they were managed by a multidisciplinary team to identify suitable evidence-based, individualized treatment plans. Lay abstract: Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a skin cancer with a high risk of recurrence and distant spread. Optimal care of this cancer is important. However, management is challenging because it is rare and its treatment is continuously evolving across multiple specialties. While treatment guidelines offer a broad overview of management, they are often not detailed enough to provide appropriate patient-specific assistance. Herein, we present a review of recent studies and our suggestions relevant to MCC staging, surveillance and treatment options. Each of these areas are discussed in light of how they can be ap- propriately customized for challenging situations often encountered by practitioners. We also provide representative examples of MCC patient scenarios and how they were managed by a multidisciplinary team to identify evidence-based, individualized treatment plans. First draft submitted: 12 October 2020; Accepted for publication: 8 December 2020; Published online: 29 January 2021 Keywords: customized treatment • imaging • immunotherapy • Merkel cell carcinoma • multidisciplinary management • radiotherapy • surgery • surveillance Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare but highly aggressive skin cancer. Approximately half of MCC patients present with nodal or distant metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis [1], and more than a third of patients experience recurrences despite initial treatment, with reported mortality rates of 33–46% [2]. Risk factors for developing MCC include fair skin, ultraviolet (UV) exposure, immunosuppression and older age [3], and due to the aging population, the incidence is increasing with approximately 3000 cases/year in 2020 and approximately 3200 cases in 2025 in the USA [4]. In terms of its cause, MCC can be clearly delineated into two distinct developmental origins. In the USA, 80% of MCCs are caused by Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) with a relatively low mutational rate, and the remaining 20% by extensive UV-mediated damage with a mutational rate nearly 100-fold higher than virus-positive MCC [5].

How I Treat Park, Doolittle-Amieva, Moshiri et al. MCC typically presents as a solitary, rapidly growing, nontender, red or violet nodule in an older or immuno- compromised individual [3]. However, the clinical features are nonspeciﬁc, which often lead to confusion with a benign lesion such as a cyst [3]. Despite its increasing incidence and aggressive nature that require prompt intervention and diligent surveillance, optimal care for MCC is often challenging partly because many physicians are not familiar with MCC management due to its relatively low incidence. Furthermore, the ﬁeld is continuously being updated across multiple subspecialty areas with controversies surrounding several management issues. Guidelines such as those published by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) represent consensus management of MCC. However, guidelines and review articles often leave gray areas in management because of the need to be appropriate for broad clinical scenarios but not necessarily for individual cases. Given the fact that guidelines must be quite general in nature, we believe that multidisciplinary care is essential to formulate a patient-speciﬁc management plan that reﬂects the state of the art for each medical specialty. In this article, in addition to referring to these established guidelines, we attempt to provide more context for decision-making based on the most current data and our experience. Role of a multidisciplinary team Optimal MCC care requires input from various specialties. As part of initial work-up and treatment of primary and/or recurrent disease, consultation with a specialized center would be beneﬁcial. Close coordination between a specialized center and a local multidisciplinary team (ideally through a patient health information compliant video- based case conference) allows for informative collaboration between an academic center and a regional treatment center, facilitating treatment and surveillance close to the patient’s home. For easy identiﬁcation of regional or local expertise, we actively maintain an online list of over 70 domestic and international centers and their physician leaders that have a specialty interest in MCC care (https://merkelcell.org/centers). The multidisciplinary care teams often include, but are not limited to dermatology, surgery, radiation oncology, radiology and interventional radiology, and medical oncology. Additional expertise or specialist services may be utilized if speciﬁc organ systems are inﬁltrated with MCC or if patients develop an immune-related adverse event from immune-checkpoint inhibitor treatment. The collaborative decision-making process greatly affects treatment course in a majority of cases. In our expe- rience, the preliminary treatment plan is signiﬁcantly modiﬁed in more than half of cases after discussion in a multidisciplinary conference. Flow of MCC treatment Our general approach for treating newly diagnosed MCC is outlined in the ﬂow chart shown in Figure 1. After initial diagnosis, obtaining a baseline MCPyV oncoprotein antibody titer should be considered for prognostic signiﬁcance and surveillance (please see ‘MCPyV oncoprotein antibodies as a tumor marker’ section below). Multiple studies suggest that obtaining a baseline imaging study before MCC excision and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is indicated in most cases (please see ‘Signiﬁcance of baseline imaging prior to surgery’ section below). Staging work- up and treatment are different depending on whether patients present with clinically positive or negative lymph nodes. Excision of the primary MCC site is generally indicated if the lesion is surgically resectable. Guidelines for appropriate margins are controversial, especially in the context of possible adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) after surgery (please see ‘Wide local excision versus narrow excision’ section). For large primary MCCs, if surgical resection is not feasible, deﬁnitive RT can be considered as an alternative

surgery (please see ‘Wide local excision versus narrow excision’ section). For large primary MCCs, if surgical resection is not feasible, deﬁnitive RT can be considered as an alternative option. In such cases, the in-ﬁeld disease control rate for deﬁnitive RT (60–66 Gy) is about 70–80% [6]. For patients with no palpable or radiologically detectable lymph node involvement, we recommend SLNB for most patients (please see ‘Sentinel lymph node biopsy’ section below). Treatment of the lymph node basin is indicated in high-risk patients. Tumor-involved lymph nodes can be treated with surgery and/or RT (please see ‘Treatment for draining lymph node basin or involved lymph nodes’ section). PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors are the treatment of choice for metastatic or unresectable MCC (please see ‘Treatment strategy for locally unresectable and metastatic disease’ section). MCPyV oncoprotein antibodies as a tumor marker The majority (∼80%) of MCC tumors in the USA are caused by MCPyV [5]. Antibodies that recognize MCPyV oncoproteins are found in approximately 50% of MCC patients, and patients who produce antibodies have a better prognosis compared with antibody-negative patients [7,8]. In addition, in patients who have baseline positive 1364 Future Oncol. (2021) 17(11) future science group

(D) Select patients may not undergo SLNB (e.g., patients who cannot tolerate anesthesia for SLNB or who prefer no SLNB due to their medical condition). In those patients, treatment for draining lymph nodes can be considered based on the local recurrence risk. (E) Radiotherapy to the primary site is indicated in most patients; the exception is for low-risk disease (e.g., primary ≤1 cm, lesion on the extremities or trunk, no lymphovascular invasion, widely negative surgical margin and no chronic T-cell immunosuppression). (F) Consider radiation therapy to the nodal basin in high-risk patients or if SLNB dye did not migrate as expected. (G) Consider excisional biopsy primarily or after negative needle/core biopsy to exclude false-negative biopsy result. SLNB: Sentinel lymph node biopsy; PET: Positron emission tomography. MCPyV antibody titers, changes in titers over time reﬂect changes in MCC disease burden, making MCPyV antibody surveillance a useful serum tumor marker [7,9]. Ideally, a baseline test should be performed within 3 months of treatment because the titer decreases after successful treatment of MCC. If patients do not produce antibodies at baseline, they have approximately 42% increased risk of recurrence [7]. For such seronegative patients, an immunohistochemistry test for MCPyV large T-antigen expression within tumor cells can be considered if indicated (e.g., for additional prognostic information, evaluation of clinical trial eligibility, etc.) [10]. Hence, patients who do not produce MCPyV oncoprotein antibodies and/or whose tumor is negative for MCPyV large T-antigen immunohistochemistry stain will beneﬁt from regular imaging surveillance to detect early disease recurrence. If patients produce antibodies, it can be concluded that their MCC was caused by MCPyV because control subjects do not produce these antibodies. MCPyV antibody testing can optimize surveillance in conjunction with imaging studies, because: an increasing titer prompts imaging studies to conﬁrm and localize recurrence in a timely manner; a decreasing titer indicates that there is no recurrence or that tumor burden is reduced signiﬁcantly. Recent data from our cohort suggest that the test is highly sensitive and speciﬁc. An analysis of 254 patients indicates that two consecutive increasing titers of more than 20% have a positive predictive value for disease recurrence of

is highly sensitive and speciﬁc. An analysis of 254 patients indicates that two consecutive increasing titers of more than 20% have a positive predictive value for disease recurrence of approximately 99% (95% CI: 94–100%). 90% of recurrences were detected within 45 days of the ﬁrst increased titer. In contrast, a titer that decreases by more than 20% has a 99% negative predictive value (95% CI: 96–100%) for the presense of clinically detectable disease [9]. For patients who produce MCPyV antibodies, we repeat the test every 3 months to assess disease status.

J K L I Figure 2. Suggested algorithm to interpret Merkel cell polyomavirus oncoprotein antibody test (AMERK test). (A) For seropositive patients, the AMERK titer decreases significantly within 3 months after successful treatment. A late baseline test that comes back negative (<74) may indicate that: the patient produced antibodies initially, but the antibody levels decreased to undetectable range after the tumor was removed, or the patient does not produce antibodies to MCPyV oncoprotein. In contrast, if the patient produces antibodies at any time after diagnosis, this test is positive and could be used for future surveillance. (B) AMERK titer between 74 and 150 is considered to be ‘borderline’. In our practice, this typically represents seropositivity, particularly if subsequent titer changes out of the borderline range. If titer still stays within borderline range in subsequent draws, AMERK titer for the patient is not reliable. (C) If the baseline test was done after more than 3 months from the initial diagnosis, or the size of MCC tumor at the time of the baseline test was extremely small (e.g., <5 mm), we consider repeating the AMERK test if the patient recurs in the future. (D) The AMERK test is most reliable for surveillance on patients who have not experienced a recurrence, or for detecting their first recurrence. After multiple recurrences and/or immunotherapy (systemic or local), the titer change of the AMERK testing is less reflective of disease burden. (E) Individual baseline titer could vary from less than 74 to more than 115,000. While this flowchart is designed to guide clinicians to interpret a test result at a single timepoint compared with the previous one, we find that consistent trends over time better correspond to disease status in the clinical setting. For instance, if the patient’s AMERK titer is slowly trending upward, we suggest interpreting the result as an ‘increase’ of titer and considering imaging studies. (F) In general, for the first 12 months following diagnosis, we recommend the patients have regular scans per the initial recurrence risk as determined by their disease stage and other factors (https://merkelcell.org/prognosis/recur/). In our practice, if the AMERK titer decreases by more than 70% from baseline, shows decreasing or stable trend for several consecutive draws, and the patient is more than 12 months out from their original diagnosis, we consider that AMERK can safely substitute for scans for surveillance. (G) Most patients that have two antibody tests with increased titers (e.g. ≥30% change) will eventually have MCC recurrence [9]. (H) Recurrence risk depends on stage at diagnosis and other patient characteristics. For most patients, it decreases dramatically by 2 years after diagnosis (https://merkelcell.org/prognosis/recur/). We generally recommend discontinuing or decreasing frequency of imaging and/or AMERK studies when a patient’s individual residual risk of recurrence is below 2%, or by 5–6 years after initial diagnosis.

increasing or decreasing trend is outside of the margin of error. (J) PET/CT or CT with contrast could be considered. Some studies and our experience indicate that PET/CT has higher sensitivity. If imaging studies fail to locate disease repeatedly in the setting of rising antibodies, consider alternative scan modalities (e.g., MRI) or investigate other body parts (e.g., brain, extremities that were not included in the previous scan). (K) Concurrent imaging test may be indicated. If no clinically evident disease is detected in the setting of AMERK titer increase, we suggest considering more sensitive scan modalities (e.g., PET/CT) or evaluating anatomical site that has not been evaluated by imaging (e.g., extremities, brain). (L) The additive benefit of the AMERK test when patients are receiving routine scans is unknown. CT: Computed tomography; MCC: Merkel cell carcinoma; MCPyV: Merkel cell polyomavirus; PET: Positron emission tomography. Based on the clinical utility of this test, NCCN guidelines for MCC suggest that clinicians consider determining MCPyV oncoprotein antibody titer as part of initial work-up of MCC and for ongoing surveillance in seropositive patients [11]. The test is clinically available in the USA and Europe (updated logistical information is available through the institutions running the tests [12,13]). 1366 Future Oncol.

How we treat Merkel cell carcinoma: within & beyond current guidelines How I Treat Significance of baseline imaging prior to surgery Current recommendations including the NCCN guidelines suggest that baseline cross-sectional imaging studies, for example, computed tomography (CT) or positron emission tomography (PET)/CT, to be performed as ‘clinically indicated’, such as when metastatic disease is suspected by physical exam, or lymph node biopsy conﬁrms disease involvement [11]. This recommendation was adopted based on data from malignant melanoma, which suggests that only a small fraction (<1%) of imaging studies reveal metastatic disease for patients with clinically localized melanoma [14,15]. In MCC, however, several studies indicate that baseline imaging regardless of physical exam ﬁndings including clinical nodal involvement often impacts management [16–19]. In a recent study of 584 patients, baseline imaging detected occult metastatic disease in 13% of cases presenting without suspicious physical exam ﬁndings (n = 492), which thereby resulted in upstaging. In addition, among patients who did have clinical nodal involvement, 11% of 92 patients had upstaging to distant metastatic disease [20]. Given that one in eight patients has signiﬁcant upstaging of MCC, regardless of clinical nodal status, we perform baseline imaging prior to surgery or SLNB in virtually all patients (Figure 1). In terms of the scan modalities, PET with ﬂuorodeoxyglucose (FDG), combined CT and/or MRI, has been reported to be more sensitive compared with CT alone [16–19]. In the study of 584 patients mentioned above, 17% of patients who underwent PET-CT imaging were upstaged, as compared with 7% of those who received CT only (p = 0.0006) [20]. Surveillance scanning will be discussed in the section ‘Surveillance.’ Wide local excision versus narrow excision Local treatment of MCC often includes wide excision of the primary site, which can lead to signiﬁcant morbidity and delayed wound healing. Despite many retrospective series being published [21–24], the effect of surgical margin size on local recurrence or survival remains controversial. Adjuvant RT is well known to diminish the risk of local recurrence of MCC [25]. Despite this, most prior studies have not separately analyzed outcomes of patients based on whether or not adjuvant RT was given. A few recent studies did such analysis and found that adjuvant RT is indeed powerful at controlling narrow or even positive surgical margins [26,27]. In a study of 179 Canadian patients, among these who had a narrow excision (<1 cm), adjuvant RT was associated with a lower local recurrence rate (25 vs 5%, p = 0.03). For patients who had more than 1 cm margins, local recurrence was 7% regardless of whether the patient received adjuvant RT or not. In a separate study of 188 patients who presented without clinical nodal involvement, surgical margins of more than 1 cm were associated with a lower local recurrence rate among patients who underwent surgery alone. However, for patients who received adjuvant RT, local control was excellent (1% local recurrence) regardless of surgical margin size even for patients who had microscopically positive margins [27]. As such, we believe that surgical margins should be considered in the context of possible adjuvant RT. Patients with very low-risk disease who have all of the following six favorable prognostic factors (primary tumor ≤1 cm, no chronic T-cell immunosuppression, lesion not on head/neck, no lymphovascular invasion, conﬁdently negative surgical margins and negative SLNB) do not beneﬁt from adjuvant RT. However, some of the criteria for decision on adjuvant RT are unknown at the time of surgical excision (e.g., SLNB status, histologic margins following re-excision). Hence, we propose a practical algorithm that guides surgical margin decision-making for primary tumor excision of local MCC (no clinical nodal involvement or in-transit disease) (Figure 3).

re-excision). Hence, we propose a practical algorithm that guides surgical margin decision-making for primary tumor excision of local MCC (no clinical nodal involvement or in-transit disease) (Figure 3). Sentinel lymph node biopsy For patients with no palpable or radiologically detectable lymph node involvement (‘Nodes clinically negative’ in the ﬂowchart), we generally recommend SLNB for all patients who can undergo general anesthesia, regardless of tumor size or location, because determining tumor involvement of lymph nodes informs staging and prognosis and guides decisions regarding regional adjuvant RT or nodal dissection. Unlike melanoma in which SLNB is indicated only among higher-risk tumors, SLNB positivity for MCC at initial diagnosis is estimated to be 20–50% depending on the tumor size. Patients with primary lesions on the trunk, tumor-inﬁltrating lymphocytes or lymphovascular invasion are more likely to have positive sentinel lymph nodes [28]. It is important to note that even a small tumor ≤0.5 cm can have positive SLN in approximately 15% of cases [29]. However, SLNB for head and neck tumors has a higher false-negative or technically unsuccessful result due to the complex lymphatic drainage in the area [30]. future science group www.futuremedicine.com 1367

Adapted with permission from [27]. Radiotracer for lymphatic mapping should be injected ideally before excision of the primary MCC site because surgery can change lymphatic drainage patterns. Typically, SLNB is performed during the same surgery visit as wide local excision (WLE). Treatment for draining lymph node basin or involved lymph nodes For patients who have a negative SLNB, elective RT to the draining lymph nodes can be omitted in most cases. For patients who elect not to have SLNB or if it cannot be performed due to co-morbidities that increase risk of general anesthesia, WLE with or without adjuvant RT is similarly considered depending on individual known risk factors for local or regional recurrence. For patients with clinical nodal involvement, pathologic conﬁrmation of lymph node involvement is recommended. Excision and/or adjuvant RT to the primary site are indicated for disease with microscopic (SLNB positive) or macroscopic (clinically detectable) lymph nodes involvement. For microscopic disease involvement of lymph nodes, deﬁnitive RT or completion lymphadenectomy to the lymph node basin is recommended. We do not recommend performing both nodal RT and completion nodal dissection for microscopic disease because the combination does not improve local control and signiﬁcantly increases morbidity [31]. In patients with macroscopic nodal disease, RT and/or lymphadenectomy is indicated to the nodal basin. Excision of the clinically abnormal node followed by RT is one reasonable approach. Completion lymphadenectomy is also a reasonable approach depending on the clinical scenario [11]. Deﬁnitive RT without lymph node removal is also an appropriate option [31]. Potential role for hypofractionated RT MCC has long been known to be highly radiosensitive [32]. Conventional RT is typically delivered with a total dose of 50–66 Gy over 4–6 weeks. The morbidity of this radiation dose is often signiﬁcant including acute skin reactions, mucositis, chronic skin and soft tissue ﬁbrosis, or long-term functional damage (e.g., severe dry eye, diminished saliva production). Daily treatments over several weeks can also be a signiﬁcant logistical challenge [33]. Hypofractionated RT such as single-fraction RT (SFRT) with 8 Gy has been used in the palliative

Daily treatments over several weeks can also be a signiﬁcant logistical challenge [33]. Hypofractionated RT such as single-fraction RT (SFRT) with 8 Gy has been used in the palliative setting for MCC, with local response rate of 94%.

How we treat Merkel cell carcinoma: within & beyond current guidelines How I Treat Based on the high efﬁcacy, favorable side effect proﬁle and logistical convenience, SFRT in the adjuvant setting has been investigated in a subset of patients, such as those who cannot tolerate conventional radiation treatment, or who wish to avoid radiation side effects. In a study of 12 patients with localized MCC of the head and neck who elected SFRT for postoperative adjuvant RT, at a median follow-up of 642 days (range: 263–2909), no in-ﬁeld locoregional recurrences were reported. A single out-of-ﬁeld regional recurrence was observed, which was successfully salvaged. No radiation-associated toxicities greater than grade 1 (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5) were observed [33]. SFRT could be considered in patients with relatively low-risk of local recurrence, especially if the tumor is located in an area where higher RT morbidity is expected, such as near the eyelids or nose, or if existing co- morbidities restrict full-dose adjuvant RT. An additional attractive feature of using SFRT is that salvage options are not compromised in case of an in-ﬁeld recurrence. Treatment strategy for locally unresectable & metastatic disease PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors should be considered the ﬁrst-line treatment of choice for patients with advanced or metastatic MCC who do not have contraindications to checkpoint-inhibitor therapy, which is supported by multiple clinical trials demonstrating durable response from these agents [11]. The response rate to PD-1/PD- L1 inhibitors is approximately 50–70% for ﬁrst line, and approximately 30% for the second or higher-lines of therapy [36–40]. In contrast to conventional chemotherapy for which less than 5% of responders continue to beneﬁt at 2 years after starting therapy [41], among patients who initially respond to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors as a ﬁrst- or later-line treatment, response durability at 2 years is estimated to be approximately 70–80% [36–40]. Based on those data, the US FDA has approved avelumab and pembrolizumab for treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic MCC, irrespective of prior therapy. Inspired by success of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in advanced MCC, use of immune checkpoint inhibitors as neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatments is currently being investigated in clinical trials. In the neoadjuvant setting, a recent study evaluated 39 MCC patients with higher risk local or regional disease. They received two doses of nivolumab followed by deﬁnitive surgical management. Around 50% patients demonstrated radiographic or pathologic complete response (CR). The recurrence-free survival signiﬁcantly correlated with disease response at the time of surgery. While additional studies are required, neoadjuvant therapy in MCC could potentially decrease the extent of local treatment in select patients [42]. In addition, adjuvant PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor therapy is being investigated in multiple trials in the USA, Europe and Australia (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02196961, NCT03271372, NCT03712605, NCT04291885). Despite the encouraging success of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, approximately 50% of patients have either initial nonresponsive disease (primary or intrinsic resistance) or develop progression after initial beneﬁt (secondary or acquired resistance). Additionally, a proportion of patients has absolute contraindications to immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy including pre-existing severe autoimmune disease or ongoing immunosuppression due to solid organ transplant. Current treatment options are limited for patients who are not eligible for PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, or whose disease has progressed while on the drugs. Some treatment options are summarized as follows: • Clinical trials: patients should be encouraged to participate in clinical trials whenever feasible. There are several clinical trials ongoing for PD-1 refractory MCC (Table 1); • Chemotherapy: while the response rate to ﬁrst-line

encouraged to participate in clinical trials whenever feasible. There are several clinical trials ongoing for PD-1 refractory MCC (Table 1); • Chemotherapy: while the response rate to ﬁrst-line chemotherapy is approximately 50–60% [41,43], responses are short-lived with a median duration of 90 days from the start of therapy. In our practice, we prioritize clinical trials or other options ﬁrst and typically reserve chemotherapy for palliation of rapidly growing disease or as bridge therapy to a subsequent treatment; • SFRT or hypofractionated RT: for oligometastatic disease or symptomatic tumor masses, hypofractionated RT can be considered as an option, especially if an effective systemic therapy is not available or to debulk the tumor prior to starting a subsequent systemic therapy. In a retrospective analysis of MCC treated with SFRT, the objective response rate in irradiated tumors was 94% [34]. Hypofractionated RT could also be used in conjunction with a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor to control refractory disease. In-ﬁeld and abscopal responses have been reported in patients with metastatic MCC progressing on PD-1 checkpoint blockade [44]; • Ipilimumab: ipilimumab is an antiCTLA-4 agent, which could potentially synergize with a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor in MCC.

L1 inhibitors, who were treated with ipilimumab monotherapy or in combination with anti-PD-1, objective responses were reported in four patients [45]; • Intralesional treatment: MCC tumors that are located superﬁcially (e.g., skin or superﬁcial lymph nodes, which can be found by ultrasound) are ideal candidates for intralesional injection treatment. In a trial of G100, a Toll-like receptor-4 agonist, the drug induced antitumor immune responses that were associated with partial responses (PRs) lasting 33+ months in two out of seven patients with metastatic MCC [46]. Intratumoral delivery of IL-12 with electroporation was investigated in a clinical trial. Among 12 patients with metastatic MCC, three patients (25%) responded, two of whom had durable clinical beneﬁt (16 and 55+ months, respectively) [47]. Among commercially available agents, talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) has been reported to be successful in several case reports including PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor-refractory MCC [48–52]. Several clinical trials are currently available including T-VEC, Toll-like receptor-9 agonist or vaccines (NCT02819843, NCT03684785); • Pazopanib: pazopanib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that demonstrated responses in several patients with metastatic MCC [53,54]. A trial of pazopanib in metastatic MCC reported clinical beneﬁt in nine of 16 patients (three PRs and six with stable disease). Median progression-free survival time was 3.2 months (95% CI: 1.4, 5.2) [54]. Subsequently, an observational case series reported clinical beneﬁt in ﬁve out of 24 patients (one CR, three stable disease for 5 months to 3.5 years) who were treated with pazopanib for their metastatic MCC [53]; • Somatostatin analogs: a subset of MCC tumors expresses somatostatin receptors and can beneﬁt from somato- statin analogue therapy [55]. Like other neuroendocrine tumors, peptide receptor radionuclide therapy with lutetium-177 isotope has been successfully used [56,57]. Octreotide and lanreotide have also been utilized for MCC. In a study of seven patients with metastatic MCC, three patients experienced progression-free survival of more than 120 days (median 237 days) [55], which is encouraging compared with the median beneﬁt of approximately 90 days with conventional chemotherapy; • Switching PD-1 and PD-L1: although slightly different mechanisms of action may suggest that switching therapy in between PD-1 and PD-L1 agents might be beneﬁcial, there are no data to suggest that this is effective in clinical practice. In our practice, we do not typically switch between PD-1 pathway-blocking agents (without other signiﬁcant changes in combination therapy) unless insurance or logistical issues arise. For patients who beneﬁt from PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor, a paucity of data exists in terms of deﬁning the appropriate duration of ICI after achieving CR or PR. Most clinical trials treat patients for 1–2 years. In our preliminary analysis of 59 patients who received PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors with CR or PR and then discontinued therapy, 33% of patients recurred after discontinuation (n = 20). One potential strategy to avoid disease recurrence following discontinuation of incompletely treated MCC would be to continue administration of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors for a longer period but at markedly lower frequency (e.g., every 3 months). Such a concept needs to be explored in detail. Immunosuppressed patients Hematologic malignancy, autoimmune disease with long-term immunosuppressive therapy, HIV/AIDS and solid organ transplantation are forms of T-cell immune-suppression and are present in approximately 10% of MCC cases [3,58]. MCC incidence varies depending upon the method of immunosuppression, and is approximately 40- fold increased in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients [3], approximately 13-fold increased in HIV/AIDS patients [59] and approximately 25-fold increased in solid organ transplant recipients [60]. Furthermore, immuno- suppressed

increased in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients [3], approximately 13-fold increased in HIV/AIDS patients [59] and approximately 25-fold increased in solid organ transplant recipients [60]. Furthermore, immuno- suppressed (IS) patients have signiﬁcantly worse survival compared with immunocompetent patients [33,61]. Several treatment strategies can be considered for IS patients. For patients who are taking an immunosuppressant for their underlying condition (e.g., autoimmune disease, organ transplantation), we recommend modiﬁcation or removal of immunosuppressive drugs whenever possible. Spontaneous regression of metastatic MCC by removal of iatrogenic-immunosuppression has been reported [62]. However, limited data exist to guide optimal selection of immunosuppressive drugs that balance antitumor immunity and control of the underlying condition [63]. From the malignancy risk standpoint, glucocorticoids, TNF-α inhibitors or methotrexate have been believed to be relatively safe in this setting [63–65]. Drugs with T-cell inhibitory mechanism (e.g., cyclosporine) or DNA synthesis inhibitors (e.g., azathioprine, cyclophosphamide) are thought to confer higher risk [64]. However, the level of evidence is low and heterogeneous depending on the type of immunosuppressive condition, cancer type, etc. Comanagement of immunosuppression by careful multidisciplinary collaboration is critical for optimally adjusting immune suppression. 1370 Future Oncol.

For IS patients who require systemic treatment, PD-1/PD-L1 blockade is considered to be ﬁrst-line therapy in patients without a contraindication. However, data for response rate in this population are sparse. In one study of 50 IS patients treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors for metastatic MCC [66], there was a 56% response rate, which is similar to that of immunocompetent patients [40]; however, the response rate in CLL patients was only 18%. Pre-existing autoimmunity in a patient with advanced MCC presents a particularly difﬁcult challenge given that immune checkpoint inhibition may worsen the underlying autoimmune disease.

a particularly difﬁcult challenge given that immune checkpoint inhibition may worsen the underlying autoimmune disease. In a study of 52 melanoma patients with pre-existing autoimmune disease, 38% patients had a ﬂare of disease after ICI treatment. Moreover, if continued immunosuppression is required during the initiation phase of the immunotherapy, it may decrease the response rate [67]. Despite those limitations, we consider ICI for patients with autoimmune disease in the setting of metastatic MCC because of its durability of response. An ongoing prospective trial to evaluate the safety and efﬁcacy of immunotherapy in autoimmune disease patients is currently underway (NCT03816345). Surveillance While MCC is known to have a high rate of recurrence in general [2], individual risk of recurrence differs by stage (20% for stage I disease to 75% for stage III disease) and other patient-speciﬁc risk factors such as age, gender, future science group www.futuremedicine.com 1371

How I Treat Park, Doolittle-Amieva, Moshiri et al. immunosuppression, MCPyV status or tumor location [68]. In addition, the risk of recurrence decreases over several years with increasing time since initial diagnosis and treatment. A majority (∼80%) of recurrences occur within 2 years of the initial diagnosis [69]. However, the rate of decrease in risk is signiﬁcantly different based on the stage and patient-speciﬁc risk factors. As such, it is important to discuss an individual patient’s prognosis and recurrence risk at the time of initial management. Follow-up should also be individualized according to current recurrence risk, potential therapeutic options and patient preference. An individualized, web-based risk calculator, which integrates several relevant factors mentioned above, can assist in determining a patient’s risk of recurrence and the appropriate frequency of surveillance studies (https://merkelcell.org/recur/). For low-risk patients (e.g., stage I–II disease with no additional risk factors), we typically consider regular imaging every 6 months for the ﬁrst 2–3 years, then every 9–12 months until the recurrence risk decreases below 2%. For high-risk patients (e.g. stage III–IV disease and/or with prominent risk factors such as immunosuppression), we consider imaging every 3 months for the ﬁrst 2–3 years, and thereafter, every 6–12 months until recurrence risk decreases below 2%. MCPyV oncoprotein antibody testing can be used instead of or in conjunction with imaging studies. We typically perform the test every 3 months while the patient’s risk remains or over 2%. For patients with local disease (stages I and II) who experience recurrences, 40–60% patients develop local and/or nodal recurrences, while the remaining patients have distant metastasis. In advanced-stage disease (stage III), approximately 80% of recurrences are distant [68]. In a study of 215 patients with distant metastatic disease after initial diagnosis of locoregional disease (stage I–III), nonregional lymph nodes were the most common site (41%), followed by skin/body wall (25%) and liver (23%). Lung and brain were relatively less often involved (7 and 5%, respectively). This is an important difference from patterns of melanoma recurrence, in which approximately 10–30% of metastases occur in lung and brain [70]. Representative cases of MCC management Case 1: typical management of low-risk local MCC, surveillance with MCPyV antibody serum testing An 81-year-old woman presented with a 2 cm local MCC involving her right upper eyelid. Her baseline scans did not show distant metastasis. She underwent treatment with surgical excision and reconstruction, as well as negative SLNB (0/5 lymph nodes from the right neck); American Joint Committee on Cancer, AJCC, 8th edition, pathologic stage I). She received adjuvant radiation therapy to the right upper eyelid given her approximately 20% risk of local recurrence [71]. MCPyV antibody serum test was performed 1 month after her initial diagnosis and was positive at a titer of 934 (Serum titer units [STU]). Three months later, her antibody titer had decreased to 213. Eight months after the WLE, her antibody titer had decreased further to the negative range (<74). Her declining antibody titer corresponded to CT scans of the head, neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis with no evidence of recurrent or metastatic disease. She continued to receive surveillance via concurrent CT scans and MCPyV antibody serum testing every 6 months for the ﬁrst 2 years. MCPyV antibody serum testing was used as the sole method for surveillance for an additional 3 years, sparing substantial expense and radiation exposure, and continued to be in the negative range. Case 2: a high-risk patient who later developed metastatic disease, treated with anti-PD-1 A 61-year-old man presented with a 2cm MCC of the left cheek. His baseline scans did not show distant metastasis, and MCPyV antibody titer within 3 months from his initial diagnosis was

man presented with a 2cm MCC of the left cheek. His baseline scans did not show distant metastasis, and MCPyV antibody titer within 3 months from his initial diagnosis was negative. He underwent WLE of the primary tumor, and SLNB that was positive for microscopic metastasis in one of two left preauricular lymph nodes (AJCC 8th edition, pathologic stage IIIA). Based on his disease stage and medical condition, his overall risk of recurrence was estimated to be approximately 50% over the next 5 years (https://merkelcell.org/recur/). He underwent postoperative radiation therapy to the primary site and draining lymph node basin (56 Gray). Three months after completion of adjuvant RT, routine surveillance imaging detected a new lesion in the liver. Biopsy conﬁrmed metastatic MCC. Based on the potential durable beneﬁt from PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors over chemotherapy, the patient was offered pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1), to which he has had a CR for the last 18 months with excellent quality of life. 1372 Future Oncol.

How we treat Merkel cell carcinoma: within & beyond current guidelines How I Treat Case 3: a high-risk, IS MCC patient whose disease was controlled with multiple lines of therapy An 81-year-old man with a history of indolent CLL was diagnosed with MCC of the skin of the right lower back (0.7cm). He underwent WLE and SLNB (0/3 axillary and inguinal lymph nodes involved; AJCC 8th edition, pathologic stage I). Based on his disease stage and IS condition, his overall risk of recurrence was estimated to be approximately 40% over the next 5 years. Ten months after his initial diagnosis, he developed recurrent MCC of the right axillary and inguinal lymph node basins for which he initiated systemic therapy with pembrolizumab. He was treated with pembrolizumab and then avelumab for about 1 year with mixed response. His disease eventually progressed, and he underwent salvage therapy with lymph node dissection plus adjuvant RT. Despite treatment, his disease progressed to involve bones and multiple lymph node basins. Because he was ineligible for clinical trials due to CLL, he had an octreotide scan that conﬁrmed somatostatin receptor expression and was treated with somatostatin analogue plus hypofractionated palliative RT [55]. His disease was controlled with minimal side effects from treatment for over 2 years after recurrence. Unfortunately, therapeutic options were eventually exhausted, and the patient succumbed to disease 3 years after the initial diagnosis. Conclusion & future perspective While our model does not contradict principles outlined in current NCCN guidelines, it does clarify our clinical approach and decreases ambiguity that may arise at various decision points. Despite recent progress in MCC management across specialties, unmet needs and further research opportuni- ties exist in several areas including improving technology for tumor surveillance, decreasing toxicity of existing therapeutics, reducing incidence of disease recurrence, and advancing novel therapeutics. Tumor surveillance: 50% of patients do not produce MCPyV antibodies and such patients have 42% higher risk of recurrence and thus would beneﬁt from careful surveillance. Current surveillance modalities for seronegative patients rely on imaging studies and/or physical exam, and there is no established blood-based surveillance assay. The use of a highly sensitive circulating tumor DNA assay (recognizing patient-speciﬁc DNA mutations) may provide a useful surveillance approach for virus-negative MCC patients [72]. Decreasing morbidity of existing therapeutics and surgeries: Decreasing morbidity from surgery or radiation for large or locally advanced MCC may be achievable through increasing use of narrow-margin surgery plus adjuvant RT that may be delivered in a less-toxic manner such as via 8Gy SFRT. Decreasing morbidity from large surgeries may also be achieved using neoadjuvant systemic PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors to shrink tumors prior to operation, which is an area of active investigation. Prevention of disease recurrence: Using a therapeutic vaccine to decrease the risk of recurrence for virus positive MCC is being investigated by multiple groups. Clinical trials using PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors for adjuvant treatment of stage III disease are also underway. Moreover, studies to identify optimal duration of immunotherapy in responders are needed to minimize post-treatment recurrence. Novel treatments: Most importantly, there is a pressing need to develop treatment strategies to overcome PD-1/PD-L1-refractory MCC, which ultimately affects approximately 50% of patients with metastatic/locally advanced MCC. Various combinations of immunotherapies and other modalities (such as RT, targeted therapy) with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors are being investigated in refractory patients. Several forms of cellular therapy in which T-cells are reprogrammed speciﬁcally to recognized MCPyV positive tumor cells are also being explored.

It de- velops mostly within chronically sun-exposed areas of the skin. MCPyV is detected in 60–80% of MCC cases as integrated within the genome and is considered a major risk factor for MCC. Viral negative MCCs have a high mutation burden with a UV damage signature. Aberrations occur in RB1, TP53, and NOTCH genes as well as in the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway. MCC is highly immuno- genic, but MCC cells are known to evade the host’s immune response. Despite the characteristic immunohistological proﬁle of MCC, the diagnosis is challenging, and it should be conﬁrmed by an experienced pathologist. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is considered the most reliable staging tool to identify subclinical nodal disease. Subclinical node metastases are present in about 30–50% of patients with primary MCC. The basis of MCC treatment is surgical excision. MCC is highly radiosensitive. It becomes chemoresistant within a few months. MCC is prone to recurrence. The outcomes in patients with metastatic disease are poor, with a historical 5-year survival of 13.5%. The median progression-free survival is 3–5 months, and the median overall survival is ten months. Currently, immunotherapy has become a standard of care ﬁrst-line therapy for advanced MCC. Keywords: Merkel cell carcinoma; tumor mutational burden; immunotherapy; TP53; polyomavirus 1. Introduction Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is an uncommon and highly aggressive skin cancer developing within the dermis and subcutis. It has an immunophenotype (Cytokeratin 20—CK20) corresponding to sensory Merkel cells of the skin—mechanoreceptor cells of the basal layer of the epidermis. More detailed analysis accumulating over the last years suggests that MCC cells

to sensory Merkel cells of the skin—mechanoreceptor cells of the basal layer of the epidermis. More detailed analysis accumulating over the last years suggests that MCC cells (CK20+, CD56+, CKAE1/AE3+, NSE+, PAX5+, NSP+, TdT+, SATB2+, TTF-1−, LCA−, S100−, p40−, chromogranin+/−, and synaptophysin+/−) are not the progeny of mature Merkel cells (Cytokeratin 20—CK20+), and the true origin of MCC remains unknown [1]. There are a few hypotheses about the cellular origin of MCC, including deriving from epidermal and dermal stem cells, dermal ﬁbroblasts, as well Int. J. Mol.

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 6305 2 of 39 as pre/pro B cells [2]. MCC incidence rate is estimated at 0.25–0.32 per 100,000 persons annually, reaching 9.8 per 100,000 persons annually among people older than 85 years. The incidence is increasing steeply, most likely due to the aging population, improved recognition, and rising awareness of MCC [3]. The 10-year survival rate is estimated to be around 57% [4,5]. The prevalence in men is 1.5 times higher than in women. It devel- ops within chronically sun-exposed areas of the skin and mostly affects the fair-skinned population at an advanced age. Around 30–50% of MCC cases occur within the skin of the head, while other common sites are upper and lower extremities [4,6]. It is very rarely detected within oral or genital mucous membranes [7]. Immunosuppression, excessive UV exposure, and Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) infection are the greatest risk factors for MCC. In fact, MCC incidence is rising over the last years due to the aging of the popula- tion, increased sun exposure, and increased use of immunosuppressive medications [8]. Immunological disorders such as AIDS or hematological malignancies such as chronic lymphatic leukemia, as well as solid-organ transplantations and UV light, result in the impairment of the immune response, which plays a particularly important role in MCPyV+ MCC development. In the process of non-viral-mediated carcinogenesis, ultraviolet radia- tion damages DNA [9–12]. MCPyV- MCCs contain numerous DNA mutations caused by UV damage, whereas MCPyV+ MCCs have an incorporated viral genome and few muta- tions with “UV signature”. MCPyV- MCCs have between a 25- and 90-fold increased rate of UV-induced mutations compared to MCPyV+ MCCs. Moreover, in the viral-mediated mechanism, the majority of genes are intact, and interaction between these wild-type genes and viral proteins results in the development of MCCs [9,13,14]. Additionally, the MCPyV+ MCC patients have a three-fold higher 5-year survival rate than MCPyV- MCC ones [15]. The median mutation burden in MCPyV- MCCs is estimated to be 1121 somatic single nucleotide variants (SSNVs) per exome with frequently downregulated RB1 and TP53. Mutations affect genes responsible for chromatin modiﬁcations (ASXL1, MLL2/3) and DNA damage repair (ATM, MSH2, BRCA2). Aberrations of x-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) (MAP3K1, TRAF7) were also identiﬁed. Activation of the PI3K pathway and suppression of the NOTCH pathway are present in MCCs [14]. Virus-positive and virus-negative MCC of unknown primary origin (MCC-UP) exhibit an immune proﬁle similar to virus-positive and virus-negative primary cutaneous MCCs. Both virus-positive and -negative MCC-UP are immunogenic with high intratumoral PD-L1 expression as well as intratumoral CD8 and FoxP3 inﬁltrates. Moreover, MCPyV-negative MCC-UP tumors present typical UV signatures and high tumor mutational burden, and in contrast, low numbers of mutations are found in MCPyV-positive MCC-UPs [16]. The diagnostic clues for identiﬁcation of MCC can be described by the AEIOU acronym (A—asymptomatic; E—expanding rapidly; I—immune-suppressed; O—older than 50 years; U—UV-exposed skin). While around 90% of MCC patients fulﬁll at least three criteria, only in 7% of them are all ﬁve detected. MCC is known to be solitary, and it is characterized as a ﬁrm, ﬂesh-colored, or red-violaceous nodule with a shiny and smooth surface. Telangiecta- sia could also be observed. Merkel cell carcinoma can be clinically indistinguishable from other cutaneous malignancies, such as amelanotic melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma, or basal cell carcinoma [7,17,18]. Nevertheless, the histopathological review from the excisional biopsy is essential to conﬁrm MCC diagnosis. In the microscopic examination, MCC manifests as expansile, nodular, or diffusely inﬁltrative lesions. Most MCC cases display neuroendocrine morphology. It consists of small blue cells with round or oval nuclei. There are plentiful active mitoses

as expansile, nodular, or diffusely inﬁltrative lesions. Most MCC cases display neuroendocrine morphology. It consists of small blue cells with round or oval nuclei. There are plentiful active mitoses and apoptotic bodies. The nuclear–cytoplasmic ratio is high, and cytoplasm is scant. Granular chromatin creates “salt and pepper” nuclei, which are characteristic of neuroendocrine tumors. Further diagnosis is based on immuno- histochemical staining, which differentiates MCC cells (CK20+, CD56+, CKAE1/AE3+, NSE+, PAX5+, NSP+, TdT+, SATB2+, TTF-1−, LCA−, S100−, p40−, chromogranin+/−, and synaptophysin+/−) from other cancer cells such as basal cell carcinoma, metastatic neuroendocrine carcinoma, lymphoma, or Ewing sarcoma.

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 6305 3 of 39 (MRI), allow detecting local and distant metastases (Figure 1) [4,7,9,19]. The aforemen- tioned types of examinations reveal crucial prognostic factors such as the size of the primary lesion, the presence of regional lymph node involvement, and distant metastases. This information is vital to assess the stage of the lesion according to the eighth edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM (tumor–node–metastases) criteria. The MCC stage determines further treatment and prognosis (Figure 2) [4,20]. Most recently, in radiology reports, it has been shown that positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) is an effective imaging tool in metastatic or unresectable MCC. In most reports, the glucose analog 18F-ﬂuorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) was used as a ra- diotracer, although 68Ga-labeled somatostatin analogs have been employed as well as 6-ﬂuoro-(18F)-L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (18F-DOPA). Nevertheless, currently, PET-CT is still inferior in sensitivity in detecting the early stages of MCC in comparison to sentinel lymph node biopsy, but an important role for 18F-FDG PET/CT in the staging of MCC is expected [21,22].

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 6305 5 of 39 2. Merkel Cell Polyomavirus Within the polyomaviridae family of nonenveloped, icosahedral, double-stranded DNA viruses, 13 human polyomavirus (HPyVs) species have been discovered. HPyVs affect numerous human tissues such as the respiratory system, kidney, or skin, often causing asymptomatic, persistent infection. Nevertheless, they become active due to impairment of the immune system, resulting in severe diseases, including respiratory infections, allograft interstitial nephritis, hemorrhagic cystitis, multifocal leukoencephalopathy, and cancers. The risk of developing these diseases is particularly high in immunosuppressed patients after transplantation as well as after HIV infection [23,24]. Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) infection is ubiquitous amongst humans and is usually acquired in early childhood. No route of MCPyV transmission is validated, but saliva and/or skin-to-skin close contact, as well as the fecal–oral transmission route, are suggested. MCPyV was proven to have widespread tissue distribution with higher levels of MCPyV in the upper aerodigestive tract and digestive system in comparison to the genitourinary system or lungs. About 15% of healthy individuals have MCPyV DNA on their skin. It mainly enters keratinocytes and dermal ﬁbroblasts. Seroprevalence for MCPyV depends on the examined population, but it presents a similar trend to increase with age with an estimated 53–96.2% overall MCPyV seroprevalence [25–35]. Once acquired, MCPyV becomes a life-long resident of human skin ﬂora [35]. The copy number of integrated viral genomes varies from cell to cell, with a median of three viral copies per cell. Patients with a viral load higher than one copy per cell have better overall survival than MCPyV- ones. Detection of the virus in the blood is associated with worse outcomes [36,37]. Initially, MCPyV is latent, nonreplicative after infection, and detected in 60–80% of MCC cases as integrated within the genome [38,39]. MCPyV has a circular, double-stranded DNA genome of 5387 base pairs. It is divided into the bidirectional early and late regions, which are separated by a non-coding regulatory region (NCRR) containing the viral replication origin. NCRR comprises an AT-rich tract, LT-binding domain, and early enhancer region. The late region consists of viral coat proteins VP1 and VP2, while the presence of VP3 is questionable, as well as miRNA, which acts on T antigen transcripts. The early region encodes large T antigen (LT) and small T antigen (ST) as well as 57kT. Moreover, in the process of the alternative translation initiation, an alternative frame of the large T open reading frame (ALTO) is expressed. While the functions of 57kT and ALTO have not been identiﬁed, LT and ST play an important role in viral replication [9,36,40,41]. LT consists of an N-terminal DnaJ domain, an MCPyV unique region (MUR), a DNA origin binding domain (OBD), the zinc ﬁnger domain (ZF), and a helicase domain/ATPase. The N-terminal DnaJ domain comprises a CR1 (conserved region 1) motif and an HPDKGG motif that binds Hsc70. MUR contains an LXCXE motif (pRB binding motif) and a nuclear localization signal (NLS), and it binds to Vam6p, redistributing it to the nucleus. Moreover, the pRB binding motif presents a complementary sequence for an MCPyV viral miRNA. The C-terminal region of LT is thought to bind p53 by interaction with some bridging protein or one that changes LT conformation [42,43]. LT is responsible for viral replication not only by having a C-terminal DNA origin binding domain, but also by acting like a helicase, unwinding viral DNA. Additionally, it mobilises host cellular DNA polymerases [9,36,40,41,43]. ST shares a DnaJ domain with LT and at its C-terminal region contains two zinc-binding domains (CXCXXC motif), which are responsible for ST stability, and two domains rich in cysteine and proline, forming a protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) binding site. ST is essential for

zinc-binding domains (CXCXXC motif), which are responsible for ST stability, and two domains rich in cysteine and proline, forming a protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) binding site. ST is essential for stabilizing LT by its LT stabilizing domain (LSD), increasing the effectiveness of the viral replication process (Figure 3) [9,36,40,41,43].

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 6305 6 of 39 Figure 3. MCPyV genome and large T antigen structure. MCPyV genome consists of early and late regions. The late region comprises viral coat proteins VP1 and VP2, while the presence of VP3 is questionable. The early region encodes large T antigen (LT) and small T antigen (ST). When the early region undergoes alternative splicing, it produces 57kT. Moreover, in the process of the alternative translation initiation, an alternative frame of the large T open reading frame (ALTO) is expressed. Large T antigen consists of an N-terminal DnaJ domain, an MCPyV unique region (MUR), a DNA origin binding domain (OBD), the zinc ﬁnger domain (ZF), and a helicase domain/ATPase. The N-terminal DnaJ domain comprises a CR1 (conserved region 1) motif and an HPDKGG motif. MUR contains an LXCXE motif (pRB binding motif) and a nuclear localization signal (NLS). Attachment of MCPyV requires sulfated polysaccharides like heparan sulfates and/or chondroitin sulfates and sialic acid as a coreceptor. It is internalized in small endocytic pits and enters the process of caveolar/lipid raft-mediated endocytosis. Microtubular transport, acidiﬁcation of endosomes, and redox environment are essential in the trafﬁcking. A minority of viruses are transported to the endoplasmic reticulum, while others remain at endosomal compartments. It is suggested that endosome-to-ER trafﬁcking is one of the most signiﬁcant limitations in MCPyV infection [44,45]. MCPyV DNA integration within the host genome displays a clonal pattern; thus, it is suggested that MCPyV infection precedes clonal expansion of MCC cells [39,46]. MCPyV infection is facilitated by matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), especially MMP1, MMP3, and MMP10, which degrade the extracellular matrix of the cell, providing MCPyV easier access to its surface. The induction of MMP expression is stimulated by epidermal growth factor (EGF), ﬁbroblast growth factor (FGF), and inhibitors of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), inducing WNT/β- catenin signaling. The WNT signaling pathway is also increased by classical clinical

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 6305 7 of 39 MCC risk factors, such as UV radiation and aging, which in this way facilitate MCPyV infection [1,32,40]. Viral integration into the human genome is reported within most chromosomes across genes. The site of MCPyV integration is unique for every tumor and thereby determines its further development. Nevertheless, due to the lack of integrase, integration is not a part of the MCPyV natural cell cycle. At the sites of microhomology between the host and MCPyV genomes, the mechanism of erroneous DNA repair is observed. It enables the virus to integrate into the human genome, mainly into transcriptionally active gene-dense regions and accessible chromatin as well as near short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs), B double prime one, and a subunit of RNA polymerase III transcription initiation factor IIIB (BDP1) binding sites. Moreover, MCPyV tropism toward sensory perception and G-protein coupled receptor genes was suggested [46–48]. After infection, MCPyV enters in viral latency, which means that its genome does not replicate independently and it does not produce any infectious particles. Thus, a wide array of MCPyV mechanisms promotes this state. Highly phosphorylated LT protein initiates MCPyV genome replication by binding to the DNA replication origin. LT expression is suppressed by the autoinhibition of its own promoter in a negative feedback loop [49]. Additionally, the interaction between LT and RB1 results in activation of p14(ARF), which increases the cellular level of p53 [43]. Moreover, MCPyV encodes MCV-miR-M1-3p and MCV-miR-M1-5p single miRNAs, which are located on the antisense strand of the LT. MCV-miR-M1 displays a sequence complementary to the LXCXE motif in the LT mRNA transcript, repressing it. Additionally, MCV-miR-M1 targets antiviral protein SP100, causing decreased secretion of CXCL8 in consequence, leading to neutrophil chemotaxis depletion. The host immune evasion promotes persistent, long- term infection of MCPyV [50]. Additionally, LT phosphorylation sites are recognized by Skp-Celli-F box (SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligases F-box/WD repeat-containing protein 7 (Fbw7), F-box/WD repeat-containing protein 1A (βTrCP), and S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (Skp2), which results in degradation of LT and preserves its low cellular level. Moreover, adverse cellular conditions, such as nutrient starvation, which inhibit the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase, LT mutations in phosphorylation sites, or downregulation of SCF E3 ubiquitin ligases lead to accumulation of LT proteins and replication of MCPyV and initiate spreading to uninfected cells or to a new host [49]. In fact, oncogenic transformation by MCPyV requires two molecular events: integra- tion of the MCP genome into the human genome and truncation of LT that makes the virus non-replicating. Mutations of MCPyV result in truncated LT (tLT). LT is truncated by premature stop codons or deletions that lead to loss of the C-terminal origin binding (OBD) and helicase domains, which are vital for MCPyV replication [36]. tLT preserves the pRB1-binding domain (LXCXE motif), which binds the cellular tumor suppressor retinoblastoma-associated protein (RB1 gene) and thereby releases elongation factor 2 (EF2), promoting progression to the S phase of the cell cycle [9]. tLT also retains the DnaJ chaperone, which allows it to interact with Heat shock 70 kDa protein 8 (Hsc70), releasing EF2 from RB1 and stimulating MCPyV replication [51]. It also stimulates the expression of protein atonal homolog 1 (ATOH1) and SRY-box transcription factor 2 (SOX2). tLT is known to promote tumor growth more strongly than wild-type LT or 57kT [11]. Expression of the C-terminal 100 amino acids inhibits the growth of MCPyV+ MCC, but the mech- anism is not known. It could be related to cell cycle checkpoint kinase, including ataxia telangiectasia mutated serine/threonine kinase (ATM), casein kinase 2β (CSNK2B), and

MCC, but the mech- anism is not known. It could be related to cell cycle checkpoint kinase, including ataxia telangiectasia mutated serine/threonine kinase (ATM), casein kinase 2β (CSNK2B), and phosphatidylinositol-5-phosphate 4-kinase type 2β (PIP4K2B), which alter cell proliferation by inhibiting progress from G1 to S cell cycle and promoting apoptosis [11]. Ubiquitin- speciﬁc protease 7 (Usp7) binds with all MCPyV T-antigens, including LT, tLT, and 57kT, and probably in an indirect way with ST, suppressing MCPyV replication [52]. Additionally, either LT or ST decreases tumor cell autophagy by increasing the expression of miRNAs, such as miR-30a-3p, miR-30a-5p, and miRNA-375. Those miRNAs have complementary sequences within mRNAs that take part in the production of autophagy proteins, such as autophagy-related 7 (ATG7), sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1,p62), and beclin 1 (BECN1).

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 6305 8 of 39 Interaction between miRNAs and mRNAs results in a decreased level of those autophagy proteins [53]. ST expression is required in the development of MCPyV+ MCC. ST protein plays a signiﬁcant role in promoting mitogenesis and cell proliferation by upregulation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway, which initiates cap-dependent translation (Figure 4). To promote this type of translation, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) has to bind with eIF4A and eIF4G, creating multisubunit eIF4F. By mTOR phosphorylation of 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), it releases eIF4E, allowing it to start the cap-dependent translation. ST acts downstream in this pathway, leading to increased MCC growth by persistent hyperphosphorylation of 4E-BP1 [54]. Moreover, ST binds and inhibits protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), thus maintaining AKT in a phosphorylated and active form. It also promotes the induction of the proglycolytic genes. ST inhibits particular E3 ubiquitin ligases, which normally take part in cell cycle regulation. It is known to promote centrosome overduplication (supernumerary centrosomes) and aneuploidy by targeting E3 ligases and on account of overlapping E3 ligase networks. It also induces the formation of micronuclei [55,56]. Additionally, the interaction between small T antigen and NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO) leads to the inhibition of IκB kinase α (IKKα)/IKKβ-mediated IκB phosphorylation, which regulates NF-κB heterodimer translocation to the nucleus [57]. ST binds to L-myc-1 proto-oncogene protein (MYCL), thereby regulating EP400 histone acetyltransferase and chromatin remodeling complex, which results in changed gene expression [38,58]. ST has an LT stabilizing domain (LSD), which increases the level of LT and enables it to disrupt the function of F-box/WD repeat-containing protein 7 (FBXW7) and cell division cycle protein 20 homolog (CDC20). The LSD domain plays a crucial role in MCPyV+ MCC development [9,11,36,38]. Figure 4. PI3K–AKT–mTOR pathway.

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 6305 9 of 39 MCC patients are not contagious due to a tumor-related mutation in LT where the helicase domain is eliminated. tLT prevents autonomous replication of the viral genome, thus making MCPyV non-transmittable. Moreover, viral replication is inhibited by E3 ligase targeting of phosphorylated LT, downregulation of MCPyV promoter by LT, as well as underexpression of LT due to viral microRNA [38,49,59]. 3. Immunogenicity of Merkel Cell Carcinoma The association between increased Merkel cell carcinoma incidence and mortality rate and pathological immune dysfunction suggests a signiﬁcant role of the immune system in MCC development. Approximately 10% of all MCC patients have decreased immunity. Alterations in the immune system are observed in the course of solid organ transplantation immunosuppression, chronic inﬂammatory conditions, HIV infection/AIDS, and hemato- logical malignancies. A 30-fold higher MCC incidence is observed among patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia [6,38,60–64]. Withdrawal of immune-suppressive treatment, as well as spontaneous regressions, are suggested to be linked with immune-cell mediated responses consisting of T cells and macrophages [65,66]. Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) also contributes to suppressed immunity due to the excess production of cytokine IL-10 and the generation of Tr1-like regulatory T cells. Both take part in the inhibition of Th1 and Th2 cells, which are essential for humoral immune response development [67]. As the cellular immune system is known to be pivotal in regulating MCC prevention and development, dense intratumoral inﬁltration, especially with CD8 T cells, is associated with a favorable prognosis [68–70]. MCPyV-speciﬁc CD4 and CD8 T-cell epitopes are observed in tumors and blood from MCPyV+ MCC patients. A higher number of MCPyV- speciﬁc T cells is observed within the tumor environment than in the blood. T cells could identify LT and ST oncoproteins as well as capsid structural protein antigens [71]. The MCPyV VP1 capsid protein was reported to not be expressed by MCPyV+ MCC, resulting in the lack of VP1-related responses in the tumor-inﬁltrated lymphocytes (TILs). However, anti-VP1 T cells are identiﬁed in peripheral blood lymphocytes [33,72]. In LT- and ST-directed responses, there is no difference between intratumoral and peripheral lymphocytes. While VP1 antigen-speciﬁc T cells are detected in both MCPyV+ MCC patients and the healthy MCPyV+ population, T-cell responses to the LT and ST antigens are observed only in MCPyV+ MCC patients. Additionally, LT and ST antigen-speciﬁc T cells were detected to be present even three years after removal of the primary lesion, which could be explained by the appearance of memory T-cell response [73,74]. Intratumoral TCR clonality could be interpreted as a marker of cell-antigen variety. While the intratumoral TCR repertoire in MCPyV+ MCC is clonal, MCPyV- MCC is known to have more diverse TCR due to its higher mutational burden. This phenomenon results from altered antigen expression caused by the presence of gene mutations. Those neoantigens are mostly patient- speciﬁc, and they could be used for future personalized treatment. Nevertheless, some data show that MCPyV+ MCC could have greater immunogenicity than virus-negative MCC, despite its higher mutational burden and neoantigen expression [14,74–76]. CD4 T cells, also known as T helpers, have a diverse impact on the immune system. They play an essential role in immune system stimulation by releasing cytokines and mediators, and they are also required for activation of CD8 T cells, increasing cross-presentation of antigen-presenting cells, and enhancing phagocyte function. CD4 Th1 cells produce interferon-γ (INF-γ), which is an important antiviral cytokine, while CD4 Th2 cells are the source of IL-10, an anti-inﬂammatory cytokine that suppresses Th1 and NK cells, as well as IL-13, which acts either as a promoter or inhibitor of tumor development

are the source of IL-10, an anti-inﬂammatory cytokine that suppresses Th1 and NK cells, as well as IL-13, which acts either as a promoter or inhibitor of tumor development [73]. Moreover, they are responsible for the stimulation of B cell antibody class switching. One study found that speciﬁc CD4 T cells with diverse receptor sequences were identiﬁed in 76% of assessed MCCs, and their concentration was 250-fold higher within the tumor environment than in the peripheral blood. The frequency of CD4 T cells is much lower in comparison with CD8 ones; thus, research concerning tumor-speciﬁc CD4 T cells is more difﬁcult. Nevertheless, identifying MCC-speciﬁc CD4 T-cell epitopes enables the

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 6305 10 of 39 development of CD4-targeted therapies besides CD8-based treatment [71,77]. The presence of tumor-associated neutrophil inﬁltration results in a longer recurrence-free period and increased overall survival. Additionally, tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) located near MCC also correlate with prolonged recurrence-free survival due to exceeded CD8/CD4 ratio in the tumor periphery, but not in its center [78]. Seroprevalence for MCPyV depends on the examined population, but it presents a similar trend to increase with age, with an estimated 53–96.2% overall MCPyV seropreva- lence [29–31,33,34]. As observed in the cellular immune response, anti-VP1 antibodies are present in both MCPyV+ MCC patients and the healthy MCPyV+ population, while MCPyV large and small tumor-associated antigen antibodies are produced exclusively by MCPyV + MCC patients. Thus, screening of anti-LT and anti-ST oncoprotein antibody levels is useful in the disease progression and recurrence monitoring when anti-VP1 an- tibody titer could be a prognostic marker at the baseline. MCPyV+ MCC patients with high antibody titers are thought to have a better progression-free survival, but there is no association with any tumor characteristics [72,76,79–82]. Merkel cell carcinoma immune evasion is the process that impairs the patients’ im- mune system, facilitating MCC progression (Figure 5). One of those mechanisms is altered HLA I expression, resulting from genomic modiﬁcations or transcriptional regulation. In the former one, mutations or loss-of-heterozygosity in HLA genes are observed, while tran- scriptional suppression is mostly based on epigenetic alterations, such as hypermethylation, and is reversible in the ex vivo cultures by both interferon-γ (INF-γ) and the hypomethy- lating agent 5-azacytidine. INF-γ binds with the IFN receptor, which phosphorylates Janus kinase 1 and 2 as well as the signal transducer and activator of transcription protein 1 (JAK1/JAK2/STAT1), activating them. STAT1 stimulates interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) expression, which in turn upregulates MHC I expression [83]. To avoid immune resistance to cellular immunotherapy resulting from loss of particular HLA expression, the patient requires T-cell treatment, which is targeted to alternate HLAs whose expression is not decreased. Acquired immunotherapy resistance in the mechanism of transcriptional HLA downregulation is the consequence of MCC therapy restricted to a particular HLA T cell. It is also potentially reversible with drug treatment [84]. Antigen-speciﬁc T-cell re- sponses are restricted only by a few HLA contexts, which could be caused by transcriptional loss of HLA expression on account of speciﬁc T-cell pressure [74]. Even when intratumoral CD8 T cells are present, they often show an exhausted phenotype that suppresses the immune response. It is characterized by a reduced expression of CD69 and CD25, which are the markers of early and late T-cell activation, respectively. Moreover, exhausted T cells have upregulated expression of programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3 (TIM3), and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), whose functions are described below. After in vitro treatment of MCC with IL-2 and IL-15, increased production of various cytokines, such as IFNγ, TNFα, IL-17, IL-10, IL-4, and IL-13, was observed, which enhances immune system activity. Additionally, repertoire skewing of TCR expression and upregulation of CD137 were also identiﬁed. CD137 increases T-cell proliferation, cytolytic activity, as well as IL-2 production [73,85]. Another sign of immune avoidance is the enhanced number of suppressive CD25+FOX3P+ Tregs with the downregulation/lack of activated CD25+FOXP- T cells within the tumor environment. Moreover, CD4 and CD8 CD25+FOX3P+ Tregs increase CTLA-4, GITR, and HLA-DR expression, escalating immunosuppression. HLA-DR is thought to have high suppressive

CD25+FOXP- T cells within the tumor environment. Moreover, CD4 and CD8 CD25+FOX3P+ Tregs increase CTLA-4, GITR, and HLA-DR expression, escalating immunosuppression. HLA-DR is thought to have high suppressive capacity. The proliferation of CD8+FOX3P+ Tregs is promoted by CD123+ plasmacytoid dendritic cells, which are located within the MCC environment [73]. Immune evasion is supported by macrophages switching from the M1 phenotype during tumor initiation toward M2 macrophages within the MCC development process. Their polariza- tion depends on transcription factors, including phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), recombination signal binding protein for immunoglob- ulin kappa J region (RBP-J), or MAF bZIP transcription factor (CMAF). M2 macrophage colonies could be stimulated by IL-4/IL-13, IL-1β/LPS with immune complex, and IL-

While classically activated M1 macrophages, stimulated by INF-γ and LPS, contribute to the Th1 response, alternatively activated M2 macrophages promote Th2 cells as well as tissue repair. Overall, M2 macrophage dominance supports tumor progression [86,87]. MHC class I chain-related protein (MIC) A and B production is stimulated by either viral infection or malignancy. MIC is known to take part in cell stress transmission within the immune system. It eliminates target cells by using Natural Killer group 2D (NKG2D). NKG2D ligands, such as MIC, make altered cells more vulnerable to NK cell-dependent tumor lysis. Hypoacetylation of the MIC promoter leads to its epige- netic silencing, resulting in its decreased expression. Moreover, MIC proteolytic shedding from the tumor cell surface results in decreased lesion recognition of NK cells, and the ex- panding amount of soluble NKG2D ligands in the tumor microenvironment causes NKG2D internalization and suppresses NK cell activity. These phenomena could be observed in MCC patients, causing facilitated development of the tumor [88–90]. Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR-9) is stimulated by unmethylated cytosine–phosphate-guanine dinucleotides, which are located in bacterial as well as viral DNA. TLR-9 is constantly expressed both in plas- macytoid dendritic cells and B cells. It is also identiﬁed in neutrophils, monocytes, and CD4 T cells. TLR-9 ligands contribute to anti-tumor immune response. To prevent TLR-9- mediated activation of immune cells and promote tumor growth, LT and ST MCC antigens silence expression of this receptor [91–96]. CD47, as well as CD200 overexpression, is also detected in MCC patients. CD200R is located in human monocytes and macrophages, and its activation by CD200 promotes immunosuppressive M2 polarization with increased IL-10 production and Tregs induction. On the other hand, CD47 binds to SIPRα receptor on macrophages, preventing phagocytosis of altered cells [38,97,98]. Figure 5. Merkel cell carcinoma immune evasion. To evade host immune response, MCC cells increase PD-L1, CD47, CD200, and HLA-DR expression. Boosted PD-1/PD-L1, CTLA-4/CD80, or CD86 and TIM3/CEACAM1 or galectin-9 interactions as well as decreased MCH1/TCR one result in immunosuppression. Overexpression of CD47 and CD200, promoting M2 macrophage polarization. In MCC cells, MICA/MICB and TLR9 expression is downregulated. Higher soluble MICA/MICB concentration causes NKG2D internalization and suppresses NK cell activity. Reduced expression of CD69 and CD25, which are the markers of T-cell activation, is observed. Moreover, the proliferation of CD8+FOX3P+ Tregs is promoted by CD123+ plasmacytoid dendritic cells, which are located within the MCC environment.

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 6305 12 of 39 3.1. PD-1/PD-L1 Signaling in MCC One of the most important immune escape mechanisms is increased expression of PD-1 either in tumor-inﬁltrating or peripheral antigen-speciﬁc T cells and upregulated PD-L1 expression at the surface of tumor cells, intratumoral macrophages, and peritumoral immune cells. PD-L1 shares homology with B7.1 (CD80) and B7.2 (CD86) [78,99]. PD- 1/PD-L1 signaling suppresses the immune response in peripheral tissues in order to prevent damage to normal unchanged cells. The PD-1 pathway is considered to suppress already activated T cells at the tissue sites. Normally, PD-1L expression is detected on leukocytes and other cells, including those that are located within nonlymphoid tissues. Upregulation of PD-L1 is caused by inhibitory pathways, for instance resulting from IFN-γ interaction or tumor signaling. PD-L2 is expressed mainly on dendritic cells and monocytes. Nevertheless, it is also presented on a diverse group of other cells [100–103]. The PD-1/PD- L1 pathway enables MCC to avoid the immune system, resulting in undisturbed expansion. Approximately 42–49% of MCCs, 55% of TILs, and 39% of peritumoral macrophages have a strong PD-L1 expression. Neither age nor sex nor initial diagnosis was associated with PD-L1 and PD-1 number in cells. Moderate or high TIL inﬁltration correlates with 100% PD-L1 expression by MCC cells. High PD-L1 expression and brisk lymphocyte response were exclusively demonstrated by MCPyV+ MCC compared to MCPyV- MCC. Those ﬁndings suggest that tumor-speciﬁc, potentially MCPyV-antigens, increase tumor PD-1L expression; hence, virus-positive MCC is considered to have greater immunogenicity in comparison to virus-negative MCC due to better response to PD-1/PD-L1 blocking therapies. PD-1/PD-L1 signaling is a great therapeutic approach in the immune checkpoint inhibitor MCC therapy [75,78,99]. Moreover, PD-L1 and PD-L2, which are both detected in the MCC microenvironment, are expressed by CD11c+ inﬁltrating dendritic cells as well as a subpopulation of CD163+ macrophages, instead of being produced by tumor cells [73]. 3.2. Other Immune Receptors in MCC OX40 (CD134, TNFRSF4) is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily. It is expressed both in activated CD4 and CD8 T cells as well as on Tregs. CD4 T cells are considered to have more persistent expression of OX40, while CD8 T cells are more likely to have transient expression. Neither most memory T cells nor naïve T cells have OX40 on their surface. TCR–MHC interaction, activation of other costimulatory receptors, including CD28, as well as the presence of proinﬂammatory cytokines, such as IL- 1, IL-2, IL-4, or TNF, in the microenvironment lead to enhanced OX40 expression. Moreover, OX40 contributes to the two stages of Tregs development. The ﬁrst one is driven by TCR signals with additional OX40–OX40L co-stimulation, while the second process is TCR- independent and also requires IL-2 and OX40–OX40L interaction [104]. Conventionally, OX40L is present on antigen-presenting cells (APC), but it is also detected on NK cells, mast cells, vascular endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells [105–107]. Its upregulation results from the presence of inﬂammatory cytokines, including GM-CSF, IL-1, IL-2, IL-12, IL-15, TNF, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), as well as by interaction with the NK cell receptor—NKG2D [108–110]. OX40 is expressed on T cells early after antigen activation, while upregulation of OX40L is observed in APC only within an acute inﬂammatory microenvironment [111]. OX40 and OX40L interaction enhances T-cell clonal expansion, effector differentiation, and survival, resulting in greater immune response. Increased cytokine secretion, such as IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, and IFN-γ by CD4 T cells, is also observed as a result of OX40 stimulation. Additionally, OX40-stimulated T cells with expression of BCL-2, BCL-XL, and survivin play an important role in clonal

CD4 T cells, is also observed as a result of OX40 stimulation. Additionally, OX40-stimulated T cells with expression of BCL-2, BCL-XL, and survivin play an important role in clonal proliferation of memory T cells [112–115]. As MCC is known to evade the immune response, downregulation of OX40 and OX40L could be observed. Thus, OX40 agonist treatment enhances anti-tumor immunity and could contribute to MCC regression [38,114,116]. Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR-related protein (GITR,TNFRSF18), as an OX40, is a mem- ber of the TNFR superfamily. GITR is expressed on T and NK cells, and it is activated by GITRL, which is identified on APC and endothelial cells. GITR was detected on CD8+FOX3P+

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 6305 13 of 39 T cells and on CD4+ Tregs within the intratumoral environment of MCC [73]. Due to co- stimulation of T cells and NK cells, suppression of Tregs, and macrophages and DC activation, GITR–GITRL interaction leads to the development of immune response against infection and tumor [117]. The therapeutic targeting of GITR might inhibit Tregs while enhancing CD8+ T cells, hence providing the clinical benefits in MCC treatment [118,119]. CD28, which binds either to CD80 or CD86, results in increased proliferation, survival, and differentiation of T cells due to IL-2 expression, metabolism upregulation, and higher expression of cell survival genes [101]. CTLA-4 (CD152), a CD28 homolog, has opposed activity to CD28, being a negative regulator of T-cell proliferation and activity. As with other checkpoint pathways, it plays an essential role in preventing autoimmunity by supporting peripheral tolerance. CTLA-4 is thought to inhibit potentially autoreactive T cells during the initial stage of immune response development, especially in lymph nodes [100]. On account of CTLA-4 expression in MCC, tumor cells are vulnerable to anti-CTLA-4 antibody treatment. Moreover, interaction between anti-CTLA-4 antibodies and CTLA-4 on tumor cells results in activation of the EGFR pathway, which leads to increased PD-L1 expression. Upregulated PD-L1 expression induces a greater response to anti-PD-1 treatment [120,121]. Moreover, the recombinant forms of CTLA-4 ligands cause tumor cell apoptosis by inducing caspase-8 and caspase-3 [122]. Besides PD-1, MCC-targeting T cells express signiﬁcantly more T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing protein 3 (TIM3) than normal ones. TIM3 is detected on CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes, and it is deﬁned as a “co-receptor”. It plays a signiﬁcant role in immune suppression after binding to its two ligands, galectin 9 and carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1). Activation of TIM3 results in releas- ing HLA-B-associated transcript 3 (BAT3), and it also increases interaction with the tyrosine kinase FYN [123,124]. It also has an impact on CD45 and CD148 [125]. Hence, TIM3 leads to immune synapse disruption and phosphatase recruitment, as well as participating in apoptosis. It is suggested that TIM3 function depends on the presence of a main inhibitory signal; thus, due to the lack of suppressing motif, it might even act as a co-stimulatory receptor. Both PD-1 and TIM3 are co-expressed and upregulated on dysfunctional T cells; thus, co-blockade of TIM3 and PD-1 in MCC therapy is promising [85,126]. 4. Mutational Tumor Burden The mutational tumor burden of Merkel cell carcinoma varies signiﬁcantly between virus-negative and virus-positive MCCs. MCPyV- MCCs have a higher overall mutational rate with the median of 1121 somatic single nucleotide variants (SSNVs) compared to 12.5 SSNVs in MCPyV+ MCCs. The number of SSNVs ranges from 3 to 4707 per exome [14]. Another study found 10.09 ± 2.32 mutations/Mb in MCPyV- tumors and 0.40 ± 0.09 muta- tions/Mb in MCPyV+ [13]. MCPyV- and MCPyV+ MCCs median numbers of neoantigens were estimated to be 173 and 7 SSNVs per exome, respectively. That is the reason why intratumoral TCR repertoire in MCPyV+ MCC is clonal while MCPyV- MCC is known to have more diverse TCR. UV-mediated tumorigenesis is represented by a speciﬁc type of mutation, which is C to T transitions. Enrichment of UV-induced mutations was detected in 66–85% of MCPyV- MCCs, while in MCPyV+ MCCs they were not identiﬁed. The typical mutational signature of virus-positive MCCs has not been investigated. Mutational burden, as well as the number of C to T transitions, does not correlate with the primary MCC site and the patient’s age [13,14]. Those observations indicate diverse mechanisms of different types of MCC development. 5. Deregulated Genes and Signaling Pathways 5.1.

RB1 Gene The RB1 gene encodes a tumor suppressor protein called pRB, which acts by inhibit- ing cell cycle progression. pRB forms a complex with E2F, binding to its transactivation domain and maintaining the cell in the G1 phase. This complex binds to promoters of the genes essential for the transition to the S phase, repressing their transcription. pRB also

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 6305 14 of 39 remodels the chromatin structure by interaction with the proteins responsible for nucle- osome remodeling, histone de-acetylation, and methylation, including SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable (SWI/SNF) proteins, brahma-related gene-1 (BRG1), histone deacety- lase 1 (HDAC1), DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), and heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) [127]. The copy loss of the RB1 gene is detected in 45–63.5% of MCPyV- MCC cases; thus, LT-negative tumors are mostly also pRB-negative [13,14]. Additionally, there is a signiﬁcant association between tumor RB1 and viral LT antigen expression in MCPyV+ MCCs [128,129]. In MCPyV+ MCCs, a viral truncated large T antigen binds to pRB by the LXCXE motif—MCPyV-LT potently. Inactivation of pRB by MCPyV-LT is sufﬁcient for MCC tumor growth out of MCPyV-positive MCC cells (Figure 6) [130]. Addi- tional mechanisms indicated as inducing pRB downregulation in MCC are 13q deletions within the RB1 locus, RB1 promoter hypermethylation, truncating nonsense mutations, and miRNA-induced downregulation of expression [128,131,132]. Despite the difference in the mechanisms, in both viral and non-viral MCC, a lack of functional RB1 results in an uncontrollable proliferation of the altered cells. This pathologic process underlies MCC carcinogenesis [9,13]. Figure 6. Alterations of pRB and p53 functioning in MCC. Truncated LT MCPyV inhibits pRB, causing E2F release and G1 to S phase transition. ST MCPyV binds to EP400 and MYCL, thus resulting in p53 downregulation as well as MDM4 overexpression by targeting MDM2 and CK1α. In contrast, LT MCPyV induces accumulation of p14(ARF), which inhibits MDM2, thereby releasing p53. (ATM—ATM serine/threonine kinase, ATR—ATR serine/threonine kinase, Chk1/Chk2—checkpoint kinase 1/2, CDK2—cyclin-dependent kinase 2, CDK4/6—cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6, CKDI— cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, MYCL—MYCL proto-oncogene, bHLH transcription factor, EP400—E1A binding protein p400, MDM2—MDM2 proto-oncogene, MDM4—MDM4 regulator of p53, CK1α—casein kinase 1α, LT—large T antigen, ST—small T antigen). 5.2. TP53 Gene Tumor protein p53 (TP53), also known as the “guardian of the genome”, is a well-known tumor suppressor gene. It maps on the short arm of chromosome 17 (17p13.1). It is involved in cell cycle regulation, apoptosis induction, and DNA repair [133]. The frequency of TP53 inactivating mutations has been estimated to be between 10% and 87.5% [13,14,134–136]. MCPyV- MCCs frequently contain inactivating mutations of TP53 or its deletions, while

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 6305 15 of 39 in MCPyV+ MCCs, TP53 was reported mostly not to be mutated, but its activity was downregulated [9,13]. In fact, both in MCPyV-negative and in MCPyV-positive cases, TP53 inactivating mutations were reported [136]. Very recently, a complicated loop of molecular interactions was discovered in MCC pathogenesis. MCPyV LT that binds to pRB induces accumulation of p14(ARF) (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A; p14) that physiologically is an inhibitor of MDM2 (p53 ubiquitin ligase). At the same time, expression of ST reduced p53 activity. MCPyV ST recruits MYCL proto-oncogene to the EP400 chromatin remodeling complex that decreases p53 expression—MCPyV complex inactivates p53. EP400 targets MDM2 and CK1α, activators of MDM4. As an effect, high levels of MDM4, which binds the p53 tumor suppressor protein and inhibits its activity, are detected (Figure 6) [137]. 5.3. NOTCH Genes In MCCs, mutations also occur in the NOTCH family, which can function as either oncogenic or suppressor genes, depending on the type of cell. Both NOTCH1 signaling, which takes part in cell fate determination, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, and NOTCH2 signaling, which is responsible for the determination of the cell destiny in the embryo as well as for regulation of the immune system and tissue repair, are particularly affected in MCCs. A total of 75% of MCPyV-MCCs demonstrate NOTCH alterations, where NOTCH1 mutations are identiﬁed in 50–96% of MCCs cases [138]. The majority of mutations contain a typical UV signature. NOTCH mutations are mostly identiﬁed within EGF and ankyrin repeat regions, which conﬁrms the inactivating nature of these mutations. Loss-of-function mutations occurring in MCPyV-MCCs indicate their suppressive role in MCCs and other neuroendocrine malignancies [9,13,14]. It was shown that the expression of NOTCH3 is an independent predictor of MCC outcome [139]. 5.4. Hedgehog Signaling Pathway The hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway regulates growth in embryos as well as en- ables maintenance of the stem/progenitor cell population and control of hair follicle and sebaceous gland development. HH signaling also controls cell proliferation by upreg- ulation of MYCN, cyclin D, and E, as well as forkhead box protein M1 (FOXM1) [140]. It is activated by HH ligands including Sonic HH, Indian HH, and Desert HH as well as by alternative cascades triggered by V-Ki-Ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma 2 viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β), phosphatidylinositol-4,5- bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K), AKT serine/threonine kinase (protein kinase B, PKB), and protein kinase C alpha (PKC-α) that stimulate glioma-associated oncogene (GLI) zinc ﬁnger transcription factor (TF) [141]. In the conventional pathway, HH ligand binds to trans- membrane receptors—protein patched homolog 1 (PTCH1) and protein patched homolog 2 (PTCH2), which sustain PTCH-SMO (Smoothened, Frizzled Family Receptor) inhibi- tion. SMO transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor releases GLI proteins (GLI1/2/3) from their repressor—cytoplasmic suppressor of fused homolog 9 (SUFU) protein [142]. GLI TFs transmit the signal to the nucleus, and depending on its type (GLI1—activation, GLI2/3—activation or suppression), they regulate transcription of target genes, including cell cycle regulators such as E2F, D-type cyclins, Cyclin A2, CDK1, and Cyclin B1, as well as proto-oncogene int-1 homolog (WNT), TGF-β, forkhead transcription factor (FOXE1), zinc ﬁnger protein SNAI1, PTCH1, and itself—GLI1. GLI1 creates a positive feedback loop, whereas PTCH1, PTCH2, and hedgehog interacting protein (HIP) act as negative regula- tors [140,143–147]. Hedgehog pathway-related genes are upregulated in the majority of MCCs cases. Altered expression was observed in Sonic HH (93%), PTCH (86%), GLI3 (86%), Indian HH (84%), SMO (79%), GLI1, and GLI2 (79%) genes. Moreover, higher expression of Sonic HH was identiﬁed in virus-positive MCCs in

Moreover, higher expression of Sonic HH was identiﬁed in virus-positive MCCs in comparison with virus-negative ones. Increased expression of Sonic HH, Indian HH, PTCH, and GLI1 was signiﬁcantly correlated with a better patient prognosis [148,149].

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 6305 16 of 39 5.5. PI3K–AKT–mTOR Pathway The PI3K–AKT–mTOR pathway is known to be overactivated in MCCs. Phosphatidyli- nositol 3-kinase (PI3K), whose p110α subunit is encoded by the PIK3CA gene, takes part in cell movement, growth, and proliferation as well as migration and translation of new proteins. Moreover, it phosphorylates signaling molecules that transmit signals from the cytoplasm to the cell nucleus and is involved in the regulation of insulin and maturation of fat cells. Thus, the PI3K/AKT pathway is essential for cell survival. PTEN acts as a negative regulator of PI3K and is a tumor suppressor, preventing the cell from growing and dividing uncontrollably. Allelic loss at 10q23 is associated with loss of the PTEN gene. Gain-of-function mutations in AKT1, HRAS, and KRAS have also been reported. Moreover, activating mutations occur in phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate dependent Rac exchange factor 2 (PREX2), which is an inhibitor of PTEN [9,13,14,150]. 5.6. Chromatin Modifying Genes BMI-1 is a subunit of the polycomb repressor complex 1 (PRC1), which performs chromatin remodeling by histone 2A monoubiquitylation and its further methylation. It plays an important role in the regulation of morphogenesis in embryonic development and hematopoiesis during pre- and postnatal life, controlling the cell cycle as well as the DNA damage response [151]. BMI-1 expression is altered in 78% of MCCs [152]. Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is a member of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). This complex methylates lysine 27 of histone H3, causing inhibition of gene transcription and heterochromatin formation [153]. In 54% of MCC, EZH2 is overexpressed and results in downregulation of tumor suppressor genes, thus contributing to tumor progression. Higher expression of EZH2 is associated with a poorer MCC patient’s prognosis [154,155]. Lysine methyltransferase 2D (KMT2D) and lysine methyltransferase 2C (KMT2C) encode mixed-lineage leukemia 2 (MLL2) and mixed-lineage leukemia 3 (MLL3), respectively. Both KMT2D and KMT2C are tumor suppressors and are downregulated in MCC. Moreover, KMT2D was demonstrated to be involved in MCPyV integration, which leads to the inactivation of this tumor suppressor in MCPyV+ MCC [14,46]. Additionally, sex combs like transcriptional regulator 1 (ASXL1), a member of polycomb group proteins, take part in the deubiquitylation of mono-ubiquitylated lysine 119 on histone H2A. ASXL1 is a tumor- suppressor gene, so its lower expression in MCC results in inhibition of cell-protective INK4B-ARF-INK4A signaling, especially production of p53, and as a consequence of tumor progression [14,156]. 5.7. Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors Vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) are endothelial cell-speciﬁc mitogens that are responsible for angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. Enhanced expression of intratumoral VEGFA, which promotes angiogenesis within the MCC environment, results in higher risk of metastases and is associated with poorer recurrence-free and overall sur- vival [157–159]. VEGFA upregulation is suggested to be driven by MCPyV oncoproteins in virus-positive MCCs due to its signiﬁcantly higher level than in MCPyV- MCCs. VEGFA is overexpressed in 91–95% of MCC cases [152,160]. Additionally, VEGFC is also upregulated in 75% of MCCs [152]. Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) expression in MCC correlates with tumor size as well as metastatic potential. VEGFR-2 is upregulated in 91% of large (>2cm) MCCs and in 70% of small size (<2 cm) MCCs [161]. 5.8. Tyrosine Kinase Receptors KIT proto-oncogene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase, which is a transmembrane receptor for stem cell factor (SCF) and is known to enhance the progression of human tumors [162]. KIT is expressed in 42.5–67% of MCCs, while its ligand is detected approxi- mately in 8.6–31% of them. Co-expression of KIT and SCF is identiﬁed only in 16% of MCC cases. Four KIT point mutations

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 6305 17 of 39 with higher risk of progression and metastases. Platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) is a surface tyrosine kinase receptor for the PDGF family. PDGFRA is responsible for wound healing, organ development, and tumor development, including MCCs. PDGFRA and PDGFA are overexpressed in 31.9–87% and 81% of MCCs, respectively. Co-expression of these molecules was detected in 81% of all MCC cases. Approximately 12.5% of MCC patients have common PDGFRA exon 10 S478P substitution [163–165]. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is also a receptor tyrosine kinase, occurring within many types of human tumors. ALK signaling exhibits anti-apoptotic function and also promotes proliferation, differentiation, and migration. ALT upregulation is observed in 51% of MCCs [154,166,167]. 5.9. BCL-2 Family The BCL-2 family is responsible for the regulation of apoptosis. BCL-2 itself is a pro-survival protein, such as BCL-XL and myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1). The ratio of anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic proteins determines whether a cell will survive or die [168]. BCL-2 is considered a proto-oncogene, mainly due to its pro-survival effect. As normal Merkel cells, 80–85% of MCC cells also express BCL-2 constitutively. There were no differences in MCPyV DNA between BCL-2 positive and negative MCC. BCL-2 negative tumors are more likely to metastasize and have lower overall survival compared to BCL-2 positive MCCs [169,170]. Anti-BCL-2 therapy alone was considered insufﬁcient. Glaucarubin-induced DNA damage results in apoptosis of MCPyV+ MCC, promoting its regression. Thus, the combination of BCL-2 inhibition and DNA damage-induced apoptosis constitutes a future treatment strategy for virus-positive MCCs [171]. MCL-1 sequesters pro-apoptotic BAK/BAX proteins, resulting in inhibition of apoptosis. It is altered in approximately 88% of MCC patients. MCL-1 targeting therapy may be a promising tumor treatment [152,172]. 5.10. Toll-Like Receptors Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a signiﬁcant role in the ﬁrst line of the immune system. They are expressed in all innate immune cells and in cells of other tissues. TLRs recognize either exogenous or endogenous danger signs, pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), respectively. PAMPs are known to be microbial molecular structures, including pathogen-speciﬁc proteins, lipoteichoic acid, peptidoglycan from Gram-positive bacteria, and lipopolysaccharide of the Gram-negative bacteria outer membrane as well as RNA of viruses and DNA from viruses and bacteria. DAMPs are products of host cell injury or non-physiological death, such as extracellular matrix and plasma membrane components, cytosolic and nuclear proteins, and damaged elements of organelles [173]. TLRs altered expression is considered to reﬂect a clinicopathological hallmark as well as to be a prognostic marker of MCC. Downregulation of TLR9, which identiﬁes unmethylated CpG DNA motifs, is signiﬁcantly associated with virus-positive MCC. Nuclear expression of both TLR2, which is a receptor, e.g., for peptidoglycan and lipoarabinomannan, and TLR5, a receptor for ﬂagellin, correlates with large tumor size, while higher cytoplasmic TLR2 expression is observed within smaller tumors. Older age contributes to upregulation of nuclear TLR4, a lipopolysaccharide receptor, as well as decreased expression of TLR7, which is a single- stranded RNA receptor [173,174]. 5.11. Chromosomal Abnormalities The presence of chromosomal abnormalities is correlated with a larger size of MCC and increased risk of metastases. They are more frequently observed within virus-negative than virus-positive MCCs. The median number of extensive genetic aberrations was 5.5 ± 1.1 changes per tumor. The majority of alterations are gains of chromosome arms as well as whole chromosomes [175]. Ampliﬁcations were observed on the following chromosomes: 1 (37–63%), 3q (33%), 5p (32–38%), 6p

MicroRNAs miRNA proﬁle varies between virus-positive and virus-negative MCCs. The ex- pression proﬁle of miR-203, miR-30a-3p, miR-769-5p, miR-34a, miR-30a-5p, and miR-375 signiﬁcantly differs between those two types of MCC. Based on miRNA expression, MCCs could be divided into three groups, suggesting their heterogeneity, whereas MCPyV- MCCs are more diverse than MCPyV+ tumors. miR-203, which suppresses cell growth and in- hibits proliferation by targeting oncogenic molecules, is overexpressed in MCPyV- MCCs, while it is expressed at a lower level in MCPyV+ MCCs. Thus, miR-203 is thought to promote regression of virus-negative MCC. Additionally, an increased level of miR-105 is considered to correlate with MCC metastases [177,180]. 5.13. Other Genes Loss-of-function mutations occur in NF1, which inhibits cell growth and turns off the RAS protein (which has an adverse, stimulating effect) as well as in PRUNE2, which is a proapoptotic factor. PRUNE2 is suppressed in 62.5% of MCC cases [13]. The GRIN2A gene, which encodes a protein that forms a subunit of NMDA receptors, and BRCA2, which is involved in repairing damaged DNA, are downregulated in MCCs. The ex- pression of the TSC1 gene is also decreased [9,13]. Overexpression of matrix metal- loproteinases (MMP), such as MMP7 and MMP10/2, is signiﬁcantly associated with metastatic MCC (mMCC) [158]. The p16(INK4A) and p14(ARF) proteins are encoded by the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) gene located at the short arm of chromosome 9 (9p21.3). Both of them control the cell cycle and are involved in cell senescence. The p16(INK4A) protein inhibits CDK4 and CDK6, which normally take part in cell cycle progression. p14(ARF) prevents p53 from being degraded. p16(INK4A) is upregulated in almost every MCC (97.7%) to prevent uncontrollable proliferation, resulting from suppression of RB1 gene [166]. Mutations in DNA repair gene pathways, including mutL homolog 1 (MLH1), ATM, BRCA1 associated protein 1 (BAP1), checkpoint kinase 2 (CHEK2), and FA complementation group A (FANCA), were observed in 29% of MCC patients [13,181]. 6. MCC Treatment 6.1. General Rules for MCC Treatment and Prognosis MCC should be treated in highly specialized centers by an experienced multidisci- plinary team. Surgical treatment is the mainstay of therapy in local and loco-regional primary MCC. For local disease, excision should be done with 1–2 cm margins and down to the fascia or periosteum. Patients with the clinical node-positive disease should undergo com- plete lymph node dissection (CLND). For clinical node-negative cases, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is required. In some cases, CLND should be followed by radiation ther- apy [182]. Chemotherapy is used in some cases in the perioperative setting and unresectable and metastatic disease. Adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with stage I–III disease does not improve overall survival. Neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy are not routinely recommended for the loco-regional disease but may be considered in some selected cases. Based on recently published clinical trial results, immunotherapy has become the mainstay of treatment of metastatic disease. Chemotherapy, which was the standard of care in mMCC in the past, is recommended in case of contraindications to immunotherapy. Participation in clinical trials remains a valuable and recommended option [183]. MCC has a high rate of local recurrence, regional lymph node metastasis, and distant metastasis. The prognosis is poor and correlates with the stage of the disease. 10-year overall survival is about 65% in women and 50.5% in men (57% on average for all

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 6305 19 of 39 The most important prognostic factor is the size of the primary tumor. Additionally, extra- cutaneous extension is of important prognostic value. Depending on the size of the primary MCC, the 10-year survival rate is 61% for tumors with up to 2 cm and 39% for tumors above 2 cm [184]. For patients with loco-regional disease (stage IIIB), the 5-year survival rate is 37%, and for patients with mMMC, it is 16% [185]. Lymph node involvement is also associated with poorer prognosis, with worsening of prognosis with increasing nodal involvement. Additionally, non-surgical treatment of the primary tumor is associated with worse outcomes, and positive or narrow surgical margins, lymphovascular invasion, and location in the head or neck are associated with poorer prognosis [182,186,187]. Comor- bidities like HIV, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), solid organ transplant, and chronic T-cell immunosuppression are also known risk factors [182]. 6.2. MCC Staging The appropriate MCC management requires proper staging. MCC staging is per- formed according to the 8th edition of AJCC classiﬁcation (American Joint Commission on Cancer). This system is based on the analysis of prognostic factors from 9387 MCC cases in the US [188–190]. 6.3. Treatment of MCC Stage I–II The goal of surgical treatment is complete surgical excision with clear surgical margins. Surgical margins have to be balanced with the morbidity of the surgery. The current guidelines include wide (to a margin of at least 1–2 cm) deﬁnitive scar excision. In some cases, when tissue sparing is necessary, Mohs micrographic surgery and modiﬁed Mohs surgery or other methods may be considered. If radiation therapy is planned, narrow surgical margins are likely sufﬁcient. In the absence of detectable metastases to regional lymph nodes, a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is recommended. The sentinel lymph node metastases occur in 25–35% of patients with no clinically detected metastases. The risk of micrometastases increases signiﬁcantly in patients with a primary focus greater than 1 cm in diameter [182,191,192]. For patients with local or loco-regional disease who are not candidates for surgical treatment or refuse surgery, treatment including deﬁnitive radiotherapy or radiochemotherapy may be an acceptable option. 6.4. Treatment of MCC Stage III In cases of the presence of metastases to regional lymph nodes (both micro-and macrometastases; stage III, Figure 7), complete lymph node dissection (CLND) is indicated. Adjuvant radiotherapy to the bed after lymph node dissection may improve treatment outcomes [193]. In some selected cases, perioperative systemic chemotherapy may be considered, but data about the efﬁcacy of this approach are limited. No survival beneﬁt has been reported in retrospective studies [194–196]. Even though the preliminary results of the trials with immunotherapy in the neoadju- vant setting are promising, this systemic treatment should not be used outside of clinical trials. The activity of nivolumab in the neoadjuvant setting has been shown in the Check- Mate 358 study (NCT02488759). In this phase I/II clinical trial, thirty-nine patients with stage IA-IV MCC received nivolumab in a dose of 240 mg intravenously on days 1 and 15. The surgery was planned for day 29. The responses were assessed by imaging and pathology examinations. The surgery was done on thirty-six patients. Three patients were not operated on, one due to disease progression and two due to toxicity. A total of 47.2% of patients (n = 17) who underwent surgery achieved the pathological complete re- sponse (pCR). In 54.5% of thirty-three operated patients evaluable for radiological response (n = 18), tumor reductions of at least 30% were reported. Responses were not dependent on the status of TMB, PD-L1, and MCPyV. Tumor recurrence was not observed in patients with pCR. The median follow-up was 20.3 months.

In this group of patients, no unexpected toxic effects were reported [197]. Figure 7. Locally advanced, unresectable MCC with in-transit metastases (stage III) in immunocom- promised patient (patient with CLL, chronic lymphocytic leukemia). 6.5. Radiotherapy MCC is considered a radiosensitive tumor. Adjuvant radiotherapy in MCC could eliminate micrometastases and occult disease. However, there is a lack of evidence coming from randomized controlled trials. In a large retrospective analysis of 6908 patients with MCC, adjuvant radiotherapy signiﬁcantly improved overall survival in patients without lymph node metastases (stage I and II) in comparison to non-irradiated patients [198]. Nevertheless, the same analysis showed that adjuvant radiotherapy did not improve the survival of patients with stage III disease. Other retrospective studies conﬁrmed the beneﬁt of adjuvant radiotherapy for local control and survival [193,199–201]. Thus, adjuvant radio- therapy should be considered in the majority of patients with stage I-III MCC after surgery, especially those with a primary tumor larger than 2 cm, inadequate surgical margins, lymphovascular space invasion, primary site in head and neck, or immunodeﬁciency [182]. There are no clear recommendations regarding target volumes, but in the vast majority of reports and protocols, elective margins are extensive, achieving 5 cm added to the primary tumor bed volume [182,202,203]. Moreover, it is recommended to consider encompassing the draining lymph node stations localized within 20 cm of the primary tumor [195,196]. The decision of elective lymph node irradiation should be based on nodal status. Adju- vant radiotherapy may be omitted in the case of negative SLNB in anatomical areas that are not at risk of false-negative results or after lymphadenectomy in the case of a single macroscopic clinically detected lymph node without extracapsular extension. The clear indications for nodal irradiation are clinically evident lymphadenopathy or positive SNLB

Due to the high radiosensitivity of MCC, deﬁnitive radiotherapy or radiochemother- apy may be offered to the patients who are not suitable for surgery or refuse operation (Figure 8). There is no evidence regarding the routine use of radiochemotherapy both in the adjuvant and deﬁnitive settings. There are no clinical trials on the recommended fractionation regimens in MCC. The proposed total doses in 2 Gy fractions were proposed by NCCN (Table 1) [182]. Table 1.

Follow-Up after Deﬁnitive Treatment Follow-up after loco-regional treatment in patients with MCC should include a com- plete physical examination, including skin and imaging examinations for distant metastases (especially for high-risk patients), and these should be done every 3–6 months for the ﬁrst 3 years [182]. 6.7. Treatment of Local and Disseminated Recurrences Published meta-analyses and retrospective analyses have shown that the prognosis in case of disease recurrence is poor. Local relapses are the most common and happen in about 30% of patients treated surgically. Postoperative radiation therapy reduces this percentage to approximately 11% [204]. Local recurrences can be treated as a primary MCC and should be individualized. If possible, tumor lesions should be excised with clear surgical margins, with adjuvant radiotherapy, if not used previously. Systemic chemotherapy may also be considered. For disseminated recurrences (Figures 9 and 10), systemic therapy recommended for mMCC should be used [182]. Figure 9.

Chemotherapy Historically based on similarities to small cell carcinoma, regimens of platinum and etoposide or cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and vincristine are most commonly used for ﬁrst-line chemotherapy in MCC. Cyclophosphamide with doxorubicin or epirubicin and with vincristine combination was the most commonly used chemotherapy regimen with an overall response rate of 75.7% (35.1% complete, 35.1% partial, and 5.4% minor responses). Etoposide wth cisplatin or carboplatin was the next most commonly used regimen with an overall response rate of 60% (36% complete and 24% partial responses) [205]. In general, chemoregimens combining carboplatin, cisplatin, and etoposide, cyclophosphamide with vincristine, doxorubicin, prednisone, bleomycin, or 5-ﬂuorouracil have been used in MCC treatment [206]. Most commonly cisplatin 25 mg/m2/day × 3 days (days 1 to 3) with etoposide 100 mg/m2/day × 3 days (days 1 to 3) is used. The high RR is not followed by durable responses in MCC. Tumors often recur/progress within 4–15 months [183]. A retrospective study of 6908 patients found that chemotherapy is not associated with an overall survival beneﬁt in patients who presented with either local or nodal MCC [198,207]. In speciﬁc settings, chemotherapy is used. In a ﬁrst-line setting, RR range from 53% to 61% with a median PFS of 3.1 months and duration of response < 8 months. In a second-line- setting, RR rates range from 23% to 45% with a median PFS of 2 months and duration of response <8 months. In a later-lines setting, RR range from 10% to 29% with no complete responses and median duration of response <2 months and median PFS of 2–3 months and OS of 4–5 months [5,208]. 6.8.2. Immunotherapy One of the most recent and rapidly developing treatment options for all cancers, in- cluding MCC, is immunotherapy. Clinical studies with immune checkpoint inhibitors have demonstrated the clinical activity of anti-PDL1/anti-PDL1 antibodies in MCC. Additionally, durable responses have been shown. Due to the high activity of anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors in the treatment of metastatic MCC, conﬁrmed in phase II clinical trials, the current guidelines recommend immunotherapy as the treatment of

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 6305 25 of 39 choice for metastatic MCC. Additionally, pembrolizumab may be considered for recurrent regional disease [182]. In 2017, the FDA approved avelumab to treat adults and pediatric patients 12 years and older with metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) irrespective of prior therapy, and EMA approved avelumab as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma. These approvals were based on data from an open-label, single-arm, multicenter clinical trial JAVELIN Merkel 200 (NCT02155647). This study consisted of part A, which included patients treated in the second line (n = 88), and part B for systemic treatment-naive patients (n = 116). The ﬁrst data from part A of this study, published in 2016, resulted in the approval of this drug for MCC therapy [209]. The patients eligible for part A of the JAVELIN Merkel 200 study were adult patients, in good performance status (ECOG 0-1, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 0-1), with mMCC conﬁrmed by histology, disease progression following at least one previous sys- temic therapy used in the metastatic setting, measurable disease according to RECIST v. 1.1 criteria (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors), and adequate bone marrow, renal, and hepatic function. The participants received avelumab at a dose of 10 mg/kg of body weight intravenously every 2 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end-point was conﬁrmed objective response (CR or PR) based on independent assessment and RECIST 1.1 criteria. Efﬁcacy and safety populations included patients who received at least one dose of the study drug. The ORR was 31.8% (95% CI: 21.9–43.1%; n = 28), with CR in eight patients and PR in twenty patients. Stable disease (SD) was observed in nine patients. The responses were long-lasting and, at the time of analysis, were maintained in 23 patients. The duration of response (DOR) was at least 6 months in 92% of cases. The mPFS was 2.7 months (95% CI: 1.4–6.9), and the rate of PFS at 6 months was 40%. The PFS curve reached a plateau. The mOS was 11.3 months (95% CI: 7.5–14.0), and the OS rate at 6 months was 69%. In this analysis, ﬁve grade 3 treatment-related adverse events were reported in four (5%) patients: lymphopenia in two patients, aminotransferase increase in one patient, creatine phosphokinase increase in one patient, and blood cholesterol increase in one patient. No treatment-related Grade 4 AEs or treatment-related deaths were reported. In 74 patients, PD-L1 expression was assessed (≥1% positive cells), and it was present in 58 cases. The test for MCPyV was done in 77 cases and was positive in 60% (n = 46). Better outcomes were reported in patients who received fewer prior lines of systemic therapy [209]. The results from the ﬁrst analysis were conﬁrmed by the updated analyses with a median follow-up of 18 months and 24 months published in 2018. The patients were followed up for 29.2 months (24.8–38.1). The mOS was 12.6 months (95% CI: 7.5–17.1), and the 2-year survival rate was 36%. The median treatment duration was 3.9 months (0.5–36.3). The conﬁrmed ORR was 33.0% (95% CI: 23.3–43.8). The median DOR was not reached (2.8–31.8). The PFS values were 29% after 12, 29% after 18, and 26% after 24 months of follow-up. Clinical activity was observed irrespectively of PD-L1 expression status and MCPyV status [210,211]. The results of the next updated analysis published in 2020 also conﬁrmed the efﬁcacy of avelumab in the group of previ- ously pretreated patients. The ORR was 33.0% (95% CI: 23.3–43.8%). CR was observed in 10 patients (11.4%). In 17 of 29 patients who achieved response to treatment (58.6%), the response was maintained. Four patients had a continuous response lasting at least 3 years. DOR was 40.5 months (median; 95% CI: 18.0 months—not estimable). PFS rate at 2 years and 3 years was 26% (95% CI: 17–36%) and 21% (95% CI: 12–32%), respectively. After ≥44 months of follow-up,

High tumor mutational burden and high expression of MHC I (major histo- compatibility complex class I) were associated with trends in the improvement of OS and ORR. Long-term responses, i.e., responses for at least 3 years, were observed regardless of PD-L1 expression. Any grade AEs and Grade ≥3 AEs were reported in 97.7% and 73.9%, respectively.

Four irAE were Grade ≥3: increased transaminases, increased alanine aminotransferase, autoimmune disorder, and hypothyroidism. Eight patients (9.1%) discontinued therapy due to TRAEs. There were no deaths related to the study treatment [212]. The preliminary results of part B of JAVELIN Merkel 200 with avelumab in the ﬁrst- line treatment of patients with mMCC were published in 2017. In 16 patients, after a follow-up period of at least 3 months, the unconﬁrmed response rate was 68.8% (95% CI: 41.3–89.0). Safety was assessed in 29 patients. TRAEs Grade ≥3 were reported in ﬁve patients (17.2%). They included two cases of infusion-related reaction, one case of aspartate aminotransferase increase, one case of alanine aminotransferase increase, one case of cholangitis, and one case of paraneoplastic syndrome. They were the reason for treatment discontinuation [213]. The extrapolated survival data were published in 2018. The mean survival rate was 49.9 months (6.3; 179.4), and 1-year and 5-year survival rates were 66% and 23%, respectively [214]. The updated results conﬁrmed that 77.8% (14 out of 18) of treatment responses were maintained. The response duration in 83% of cases was longer than 6 months (95% CI: 46–96%) [215]. The next updated analysis, with a median follow-up of 21.2 months (range, 14.9–36.6), was published in 2019 (n = 116). The median treatment duration was 5.5 months (range, 0.5–35.4). Treatment was continued in 26 patients (22.4%) at the data cut-off. The ORR was 39.7% (95% CI: 30.7–49.2%), with CR in 19 patients (16.4%) and PR in 27 participants (23.3%). In PD-L1+ patients (n = 21), ORR was 61.9% (95% CI: 38.4–81.9%), and in the PD-L1- participants (n = 87), the ORR was 33.3% (95% CI: 23.6–44.3%). Median DOR was 18.2 months (95% CI: 11.3 months—not estimable). A response that lasted at least 6 months was seen in 35 patients. PFS rate at 6 months and at 12 months was 41% (95% CI: 32–50%) and 31% (95% CI: 23–40%), respectively. Median OS was 20.3 months (95% CI: 12.4 months—not evaluable). The OS rate at 1 year was 60% (95% CI: 50–68%), and in PD-L1+ and PD-L1 groups, 1 year OS rates were 71% (95% CI: 47–86%) and 56% (95% CI: 45–66%), respectively. Any grade TRAEs occurred in 94 patients (81.0%). Grade ≥3 TRAEs were reported in 21 participants (18.1%). No treatment-related deaths were reported [216]. The efﬁcacy of avelumab in the real world was assessed in the expanded access pro- gram, which included mMCC patients with disease progression during or after chemother- apy and patients ineligible for chemotherapy or clinical trial participation. The efﬁcacy and safety results were consistent with those from the JAVELIN Merkel 200 clinical trial (Table 2). The enrolled population also included patients who had an ECOG PS 2 or 3, had brain metastases stable after therapy, or were potentially immunocompromised. The me- dian duration of avelumab treatment was 7.9 months (range, 1.0–41.7). A total of 240 out of 494 enrolled patients were evaluable for efﬁcacy. The ORR was 46.7% in the evaluable patients, and 22.9% and 23.8% of participants achieved CR and PR. The safety data are limited. The most frequently reported AEs were an infusion-related reaction, fever, fatigue, rash, asthenia, abdominal pain, chills, and dyspnea [217]. Pembrolizumab, another immune checkpoint inhibitor, anti-PD1 monoclonal antibody, was approved by the FDA in 2018 for the treatment of patients with recurrent locally ad- vanced or metastatic MCC, based on KEYNOTE-017 study results (NCT02267603). The pri- mary end-point was ORR in the ﬁrst-line setting. Fifty patients with MCC stage IIIB–IVC were enrolled in this study. The median follow-up was 14.9 months (range 0.4–36.4 months). The ORR was 56% (95% CI: 41.3–70.0%), with complete responses in 24% and partial re- sponses in 32% of participants. Among the 28 patients

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 6305 30 of 39 7. Materials and Methods Pubmed/MEDLINE and Google Scholar databases were used in the process of writ- ing the review. The searched keywords were MCC, MCPyV, immune evasion, PD-L1, mutational burden, TP53, RB1, treatment, and immunotherapy. The authors used NCCN guildlines and AJCC classiﬁcation. Clinical trials for Merkel cell carcinoma, which were registered on the https://clinicaltrials.gov and https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ web- sites, were found using the following keywords: Merkel cell carcinoma and solid tumors on April 25th 2021. The graphics were created using Google Drawings. All the photos were from authors’ private archives. 8. Conclusions Merkel cell carcinoma is an uncommon and highly aggressive skin cancer develop- ing within the dermis and subcutis with an immunophenotype corresponding to sensory Merkel cells of the skin—mechanoreceptor cells of the basal layer of the epidermis. Histori- cally, advanced MCC patients have a poor prognosis, with less than 20% alive at ﬁve years. MCC is transiently sensitive to chemotherapy, including platinum agents and etoposide (EP chemo regimen), with reported ﬁrst-line response rates (RR) between 53% to 61%. In March 2017, the ﬁrst approval of immunotherapy, avelumab—an anti-PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor—has increased the PFS of MCC patients. In the avelumab trial, 74% of responses were longer than one year (median duration not reached). Thanks to the development of next-generation sequencing (NGS), the mutational proﬁle of MCC was recently described in detail. It was shown that the pathogenesis of MCC is variable with MCPyV integrated within the genome detected in 60–80% of cases. The mutational tumor burden of Merkel cell carcinoma varies signiﬁcantly between virus-negative and virus-positive MCCs. Viral negative MCCs are characterized by the UV damage signature—involving C to T transi- tions at dipyrimidine bases (i.e., CC to TT). In particular, mutations occur in RB1, TP53, and NOTCH genes as well as in the PI3K–AKT–mTOR and HH pathways. The PI3K– AKT–mTOR pathway is often hyperactivated in MCCs, and p16(INK4A) is upregulated in almost every MCC. Viral-negative tumors show low to non-expression of RB protein deriving from RB1 copy number loss and loss-of-function of the gene. Similarly, pathogenic mutations in the TP53 gene and deregulation of p53 protein expression are also detected mostly in viral-negative tumors. The presence of chromosomal abnormalities is correlated with a larger size of MCC and an increased risk of metastases. They are more frequently observed within virus-negative than virus-positive MCCs. Genome-wide copy number analysis has conﬁrmed recurrent large regions of chromosomal gain and loss. Similarly, the expression proﬁle of miR-203, miR-30a-3p, miR-769-5p, miR-34a, miR-30a-5p, and miR-375 signiﬁcantly differs between those two types of MCC. Recent data on the molecular biology of MCC enable the identiﬁcation of new potential therapeutic targets. Currently, multiple clinical trials investigating novel drugs, including immunotherapy, are ongoing. MCC patients should be treated by an experienced multidisciplinary team.

Transdermal drug delivery, which includes technologies such as CO2 Laser, Dermapen, Dermaroller and MMP®, delivers the desired medication to treat skin neoplasias and also acts in skin rejuvenation. Objective: To treat BCC lesions using bleomycin via MMP®. Methods: Ninety-eight BCC lesions in different anatomical areas were treated using MMP® technology to administer and uniformly distribute bleomycin throughout the lesion and in the established safety margin. Results: The cure rate after six months was 96.94%; and recurrences were not associated with lesion size and/or depth. Adverse effects were the expected ones. Study limitations: The follow-up time was only six months. Conclusion: This therapeutic route showed to be promising and effective. © 2023 Sociedade Brasileira de Dermatologia.

Introduction Basal cell carcinoma (BCC), considered the most common skin cancer worldwide,1 is among the most prevalent ones in  Study conducted at the Hospital Universitário Júlio Muller, Cuiabá, MT, Brazil. ∗Corresponding author. E-mail: paulopacola@bol.com.br (P.R. Pacola). Brazil. Despite the low risk of metastases, it is a cancer with a destructive characteristic at the site where it is found. It is classiﬁed into different histopathological types, compris- ing low aggressive ones such as superﬁcial and nodular, or highly aggressive ones such as sclerosing and micronodular. Different body areas classiﬁed as low-risk such as trunk and limbs, medium risk in the head and neck and high risk in the ‘‘H’’ zone of the face, genitals, hands and feet.2 The reference treatment for basal cell carcinoma is surgi- cal excision, with the choice of conventional surgery or Mohs https://doi.org/10.1016/j.abd.2022.09.009 0365-0596/© 2023 Sociedade Brasileira de Dermatologia.

P.R. Pacola, R.R. Rostey and F.F. Rizzo Figure 1 Patient with demarcation of two contiguous lesions of nodular basal cell carcinoma (A), surgical procedure, with dem- marcated surgical margins, and one of the lesions in the post-treatment period with microinfusion of drug into the skin (B), and outcome after six months of treatment (C) micrographic surgery, which will depend on the anatomi- cal location, histopathological type, number of recurrences, immunosuppression status, comorbidities, nutritional sta- tus, and surgical size, among other factors. Among the superﬁcial therapies, radiotherapy, imiquimod, 5-ﬂuouracil, cryotherapy, and photodynamic therapy showed the best performance, in that order, in relation to treatment success.3 However, the choice of the ideal method for each patient will depend on all possible factors to be evaluated, such as age, comorbidities, anatomical area, number of lesions, access to treatment, availability of treatment in the pri- vate and public health systems, histopathological type, in addition to each physician’s practical experience. There- fore, evaluating new treatment techniques in association with established therapies, becomes interesting from the point of view of medical practice. The application of drugs into the skin, performed through different therapeutic modalities, such as topical application, inﬁltration, mesotherapy, and drug-delivery (Dermapen®, Dermaroller®, CO2 Laser), aims at different therapeutic uses, depending on which technique and med- ication is being utilized. In the technique of microinfusion of a drug into the skin (MMP®), the medication is injected into the skin while it is being perforated. In this technique, the device can be adjusted, so that the needle reaches the desired level (superﬁcial, medium, or deep dermis), and the medication is delivered at the chosen level. Bleomycin sulfate, a medication classiﬁed as an antibiotic,4 antitumor or cytotoxic drug, administered by different routes (subcutaneous, intramuscular, intrapleural and intravenous), is approved by the Food and Drug Admin- istration (FDA-USA) as a chemotherapeutic agent to treat malignancies, with squamous cell carcinoma, testicular car- cinoma, lymphomas, and malignant pleural effusion as its main indications.5 Its use in the management of basal cell carcinoma, with intralesional administration through the skin, has also been shown to be effective in some studies.6 In addition to bleomycin, other more commonly used (mainly off-label) intralesional agents in the treatment of basal cell carcinoma are methotrexate (MTX), 5-ﬂuorouracil (5-FU), and interferon, with interferon- and 5-FU being the most widely used.5 There are reports of successful treatment with bleomycin in skin lesions of warts, keloids, hemangioma, keratoacanthoma, early-stage squamous cell carcinoma, and single lesions of Kaposi’s sarcoma and myco- sis fungoides.7 Aiming to evaluate the therapeutic efﬁcacy of this new technology employing the well-established chemotherapeu- tic agent bleomycin, this study proposed the treatment of basal cell carcinoma lesions. Materials and methods The present study was submitted to the appreciation and approval of the Research Ethics Committee of Hospital Uni- versitário Júlio Muller (Cep-HUJM), UFMT. This experimental clinical trial was carried out at the Dermatology Surgery outpatient clinic of the dermatology residency at HUJM. The patients were selected by convenience sample from all patients referred to the HUJM dermatology surgery outpa- tient clinic. Among the patients who were examined and had the clinical-dermoscopic diagnosis of basal cell carcinoma, an evaluation was carried out of all the included patients over 18 years of age who did not meet the following exclusion criteria: lesions in high-risk areas where surgical treatment was imperative; pregnant and breastfeeding women; lesions 588

Those who met the abovementioned pre-established cri- teria were offered the possibility of treating the disease using this technique. Those who agreed to participate in the study signed the free and informed consent form and under- went a fusiform biopsy of the lesions to obtain diagnostic conﬁrmation, histopathological type, biopsy thickness and tumor thickness. Once the diagnosis was conﬁrmed, the patients followed all the precautions for conventional surgery, with lesion delimitation by dermoscopy, demarcation of the surgical margins that varied from 0.5 to 1 cm depending on the anatomical location and deﬁnition of the margins, followed by local antisepsis, placement of sterile surgical ﬁelds and local anesthesia with lidocaine and vasoconstrictor to per- form the procedure without pain interference and reduction of bleeding (Fig. 1). Lesions that were elevated above the adjacent skin were submitted to shaving so that the entire treated surface was located on the same plane and the needles reached the same depth within the lesion and the safety margin. The intervention was performed using the Cheyenne tat- too machine and sterile disposable Cheyenne cartridges, both from MT.DERM (Berlin, Germany), and approved by ANVISA for medical use and drug delivery.8 In this study, Magnum Art.-Nr. E-MC17-R35LB cartridges were used, which contain 17 needles with a diameter of 0.35 mm. Taking into account that the device has an adjustment to regulate the depth of the needles, the maximum pos- sible depth was set as a ﬁxed parameter to standardize the treatment and the technique, which corresponded to approximately 3 mm (Fig. 2). The standard dilution of 15 bleomycin sulfate was car- ried out in 5 mL of distilled water, resulting in 3/1 mL. This sterile solution was aspirated using a 30-unit B.D Ultra-ﬁneTM sterile disposable syringe (equivalent to 0.3 mL) and trans- ferred to the Magnum cartridge. The required amount was used according to the need for each lesion, based on the size and absorption observed during the procedure. Dur- ing microneedling, the entire lesion and all predetermined safety margins were treated with at least two applications at the same point. After homogeneous microneedling, the treated area was occluded and isolated with plastic ﬁlm for 12 hours. Cicaplast® or Bepantol baby® healing cream were prescribed for use until complete healing of the treated area. The follow-up appointment for the ﬁrst evaluation was scheduled within a 30-day period to assess the therapeutic response and possible signs and symptoms that occurred dur- ing this period. After six months a new biopsy was performed at the site of the scar corresponding to the ﬁrst biopsy. Treated patients were followed at the outpatient clinic for a period of at least ﬁve years, aiming to assess possible late recurrences. If there was an early or late recurrence of skin cancer, it would be treated using another technique of choice, as recommended by the N.C.C.N. (National Com- prehensive Cancer Network). Results Thirty-two patients were initially included in this prospec- tive study, from which 116 biopsies were obtained. Of these lesions, 112 had a conﬁrmed diagnosis of basal cell carci- noma and were treated with the present technique. Two cases of actinic keratosis, one epidermal cyst, and one squa- mous cell carcinoma

had a conﬁrmed diagnosis of basal cell carci- noma and were treated with the present technique. Two cases of actinic keratosis, one epidermal cyst, and one squa- mous cell carcinoma were excluded from the study. Of the 32 treated patients, 26 returned for the biopsy six months post treatment, totaling 98 lesions that were included as the ﬁnal data for statistical analysis. An active search was carried out for the six remaining patients, with- out success, thus 14 initially treated basal cell carcinoma lesions were excluded. All patients who completed the treatment followed the protocol of biopsies and follow-up appointments to evaluate the results. The analyzed data showed 58% female and 42% male patients. Of the study participants, three patients were albi- nos, with the remaining patients having phototypes I, II and III according to Fitzpatrick’s classiﬁcation. Of the 32 patients included in the study, two of the albino patients were the ones with the most basal cell carcinoma lesions, totaling 32 lesions. Only one patient was receiving anticoagulant treatment and had to discontinue the medication three days before the procedure. Even though this care was taken, the patient reported heavier bleeding when compared to the other patients within the ﬁrst hours after the procedure (Fig. 3). The predominance of lesions was observed in the head and neck region (48%), followed by the trunk (41%) and limbs (11%). The albino patients participating in this study showed a higher concentration of lesions in low-risk areas (trunk followed by limbs). The average size of the lesions was 3.46 cm2, with 0.24 cm2 and 33 cm2 respectively being the smallest and largest treated lesions (Table 1). The 112 biopsies performed in all patients initially included in the study presented on histopathology a predom- inance of the nodular pattern (80.3%), followed by the mixed pattern (8%), nodular-sclerosing (7.1%), nodular-superﬁcial (0.9%), superﬁcial (5.4%), sclerosing (3.6%), micronodular (1.8%), and basosquamous (0.9%). Measurements of the tumor thickness and anatomical specimen were obtained in pre-treatment biopsies. The average thickness of the specimens was 2.83 mm in the dif- 589

As for the tumor lesion, the average thickness was 1.93 mm, with 0.2 mm being the smallest and 5.5 mm being the largest. The average bleomycin dose used in the study was calcu- lated based on the treated tumor area, and the average dose used was 2.26U (measured volume with the 30U B.D ultra- ﬁneTM syringe) equivalent to 0.0266 mL/cm2 of the diluted bleomycin solution. The mean volume per patient was 7.8, or 0.078 mL of solution, ranging from 3 to 30 of solution. Control biopsies performed after six months of treatment showed scarring with no neoplasm in 96.9%, and only 3.1% had residual disease, two nodular and one nodular-sclerosing basal cell carcinoma. When analyzing the persistent lesions, it was observed that the basal cell carcinoma with the largest area (8.4 cm2) was treated with an average dosage of 1.67 of bleomycin, lower than the average of the study (2.26). The carcinoma with a mixed histopathological pat- tern showed tumor thickness close to that reached by the needle (3 mm), which could be the reason for persistence (Fig. 4). At the ﬁrst follow-up appointment after treatment, the patients were asked about signs and symptoms that could have occurred as a result of the procedure. Twenty (62.5%) patients complained of pain in the ﬁrst hours after the pro- cedure, 18 (56.3%) patients complained of pruritus during the healing process, 20 (62.5%) patients referred bleeding in the ﬁrst 12 hours, 2 (6.3%) patients complained of resid- ual hyperchromia, 6 (18.8%) patients of thickened scars and 9 (28.1%) patients of atrophic scars. Overall, the side effects were well tolerated, and no patient was dissatisﬁed with the obtained result, as it was a skin cancer treatment. Discussion Bleomycin, originally isolated from the fungus Strepto- myces verticillus,9 is often used as an antitumor agent. The presence of bleomycin hydrolase in tissues inactivates bleomycin by hydrolyzing the amide bond in the beta- aminoalanine-amide portion. The enzyme deﬁciency in the lungs and skin10,11 leads to a higher concentration of the 590

Anais Brasileiros de Dermatologia 2023;98(5):587---594 Figure 4 Sclerosing nodular basal cell carcinoma lesion on the nasal tip pre-treatment (A); outcome after one month (B) and after six months of treatment (C) drug in the skin,12 and bleomycin-induced toxicity predom- inantly occurs in these organs. In systemic treatments with bleomycin, the medication may induce scleroderma-like ﬁbrotic lesions in the skin when used in high doses.13 In dermatology, bleomycin is primarily used as an intrale- sional treatment, and the dose usually does not exceed 2U to 6U per session4,14 (OBS: The bleomycin dose was converted into US Pharmacopeia Units [U]: 1U represents 1 mg [per potency] or 1000 International Units [IU]).15 Doses as low as 0.01U/mL induced a measurable clinical inﬂammatory response, and maximum induration and inﬂammation were reached with a dose of 0.1 U/mL.16 In the present study, using the technique of microinfusion of medication into the skin, 3U to 30U were used, that is, 0.03 mL to 0.3 mL. Intralesional bleomycin injection leads to direct and indirect cytotoxicity of keratinocytes and eccrine epithelium.17 Immunocytochemistry demonstrates the ﬁxa- tion of bleomycin in the tissue at all levels of the epidermis except the basal layer and most prominently in the stratum granulosum (granular layer).18 The reactions observed after intralesional administration include gangrene, onychodys- trophy, Raynaud’s phenomenon, scleroderma, and ﬂagellate erythema.19---22 After injections of bleomycin into the skin, local reactions and transient symptoms may occur, such as erythema, edema, darkening of the skin, eschar formation, pain, and pigmentary changes.23,24 Different from the intralesional inﬁltration that deposits the medication ‘‘in bolus’’, the uniform distribution and on the same plane achieved by microinfusion, showed initial reactions of bleeding in the ﬁrst hours after the proce- dure and mild pain. Subsequently, crust formation occurred, followed by atrophic scar formation. After one month, some phototype III patients showed mild hyperpigmenta- tion. Although the patients showed an atrophic scar in the ﬁrst month after the procedure, which was the predomi- nant cicatricial result, hypertrophy appeared later in some patients in the treated lesions located in the central region of the face. This reaction was possibly due to the fact that this study was carried out during a period when the use of a face mask was required to prevent COVID-19 infec- tion. Pharmacologically, bleomycin has been shown to block the cell cycle in G2,25 to cleave single- and double-stranded DNA,26 and to degrade cell RNA.27 This is due to binding to DNA by electrostatic attraction.28 Bleomycin forms a com- plex with metal ions such as Fe (II), which is subsequently oxidized to Fe (III), resulting in the reduction of oxygen to free radicals. These free radicals cause DNA breakage, ulti- mately leading to cell death.29,30 The antitumor activity of bleomycin is due primarily to its capacity to cleave DNA. The positively charged amino terminal group of bleomycin is electrostatically attracted to the negatively charged phos- phate group on the DNA, and the planar bithiazole group is intercalated in the double-stranded DNA. The DNA strand is cleaved by the activated oxygen molecule in the bleomycin ferrous complex.31 Moreover, bleomycin is known to induce apoptosis in vitro.32 This pro-apoptotic effect of bleomycin is men- tioned as another of its antitumor properties. By affecting protein synthesis, bleomycin causes a series of biochemical changes that lead to apoptosis and total epidermal necrosis. These effects are dose-dependent, and frequent injections of low doses of bleomycin are reported to be the most effective.33 Another possible mechanism underlying the efﬁcacy of bleomycin is the induction of tumor necrosis factor (TNF).16 Tumor necrosis factor is also known to upregulate the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1),

possible mechanism underlying the efﬁcacy of bleomycin is the induction of tumor necrosis factor (TNF).16 Tumor necrosis factor is also known to upregulate the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 (ELAM-1), and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), to induce tis- sue factor-like procoagulant activity in human endothelial cells, and to cause hemorrhagic tumor necrosis.34 Intralesional inﬁltration of bleomycin supplemented with lidocaine, in addition to the anesthetic effect, increases the intracellular uptake of this chemotherapeutic antibiotic. Lidocaine acts as a local anesthetic and increases the uptake 591

P.R. Pacola, R.R. Rostey and F.F. Rizzo of hydrophilic chemotherapeutic agents, such as bleomycin, through a membrane-stabilizing effect.6 Templeton et al.16 evaluated the response elicited by bleomycin when applied intradermally to normal human skin and observed that the inﬂammatory reaction started ten to 12 hours after the injections, peaked at 24 to 48 hours, and often lasted more than eight to ten days. What histopathological changes were observed superﬁcially and deeply in the skin? Perineural inﬂammation of vary- ing density was present in four of the ﬁve initial biopsy specimens. Immunoﬂuorescence microscopy demonstrated that bleomycin-treated skin showed a marked increase in HLA-DR in epidermal keratinocytes, focal induction of ICAM- 1 in epidermal keratinocytes, and upregulation of ICAM-1 expression in superﬁcial dermal blood vessels. The time course of the inﬂammatory response was similar at injection sites of all bleomycin concentrations.16 In the present study, it was clinically observed that the treated lesions showed an inﬂammatory process accompanied by crust formation within 48 hours, and this inﬂammatory process remained in a regressive manner for the ﬁrst 30 days, at which time a scar, pinkish erythema and residual desquamation were observed. The literature review showed higher rates of cure of basal cell carcinoma with intralesional inﬁltration of bleomycin when compared to other agents such as MTX, 5-FU, and interferon; however, the sample size was smaller for the bleomycin group in comparison with the other groups.35 Among drug-delivery techniques used in the treatment of skin neoplasias, MMP® has been shown to be effective. Its main characteristic is the uniform injection and distribu- tion of the medication that occurs simultaneously with the perforation, which can have its depth regulated according to the neoplasia to be treated, the anatomical area where the lesion is located, and the medication chosen for each situation. In the present study, which assessed basal cell car- cinoma lesions, the treatment was performed according to the surgical protocol for the delimitation of the lesion and surgical margins, homogeneous application, and distribution of the medication, as shown in the illustrative model (Fig. 5). The tattooing device used in MMP® uses solid needles and the drug surrounds the outer surface of the microneedles. The friction generated by the rapid penetration of these needles into the dermis creates shear stress and a turbu- lent swirl of the drug, which increases its dermal diffusion.36 Therefore, when choosing to use a hand-held hollow hypo- dermic needle or a tattoo machine, physicians should be aware that these interventions produce different patterns of drug diffusion into the dermis. Among the different nee- dle options available, the texturized (Tx) tattoo needle was selected in the present study, a characteristic that damages the skin a little more. The use of the microneedling technique with a tattooing machine under aseptic surgical conditions may also mini- mize reported adverse effects reported in other tattooing procedures. It must be considered that bleomycin also has an antibiotic action, which makes the procedure even safer in terms of infection risk. When analyzing the pharmacokinetics of drugs injected into the skin, regardless of the use of syringes, tattoo- ing devices, or CO2 fractional lasers, the authors believe that the systemic absorption of the drug upon delivery is undeniable, although there may be route differences in the Figure 5 Lesion with demarcated surgical margin, cartridge needles adjusted to maximum depth, and bleomycin evenly dis- tributed throughout the lesion and safety margin systemic absorption (bloodstream or lymphatic), in addition to the chemical nature, the molecular weight of the drug37 and the volume used.

of the drug37 and the volume used. It has been even shown that tattoo- ing pigments can migrate to regional lymph nodes because ink particles are able to move through lymphatic vessels.38 In the present study, although no dose or investigation was carried out regarding the absorption of bleomycin, there were no complaints of systemic symptoms or lymph node enlargement by the patients, possibly due to the low doses used. As for the histopathological proﬁle of tumors in the present study, it is consistent with data found in the lit- erature, where the predominant histopathological type is low-risk basal cell carcinoma (nodular and superﬁcial). Although in this sample the proportion of affected women was higher (58%) than men, men individually showed a greater number of lesions than women. In the particular con- text of this study, albino patients were the most affected. Consistent with the literature is the presence of a mixed sclerosing pattern as the most frequent in women, located in the head and neck region.39 The mean tumor thickness found in the treated lesions was 1.93 mm, compatible with the maximum mean thickness of 1.76 ± 1.03 mm (range 1---9.5) demonstrated by Amici et al. 40 The use of bleomycin via microinfusion of the drug into the skin showed to be effective in the biopsy results obtained after six months of treatment. It is known that the ideal time for follow-up is at least ﬁve years and, during this interval, the statistical data may suffer some alterations. For this reason, the patients will remain on outpatient follow-up. Although advanced cases were excluded and those that were known to require a surgical approach, either due to the extent of the disease or the compromised structures or the inﬁltrative aspect of the lesion, the present study included and treated lesions with a high-risk histopatholog- 592

It was also demon- strated that the medication linked to the technique showed to be complementary and safe to be used on the face. In addition to its efﬁcacy, the technique showed to be appropriate and sometimes advantageous in the simultane- ous treatment of multiple lesions in the same patient, a situation that is unfavorable for the conventional surgical procedure. In clinical practice, the correct indication for this technique should be based on the N.C.C.N, on tumor thickness, which can be evaluated in the pre-procedure biopsy, and the experience of each physician, taking into account each patient and their peculiarities. Conclusion Treatment with bleomycin via microinfusion of the drug into the skin showed to be effective for the treatment of basal cell carcinomas over a period of six months. It is a technique of medium complexity and easy reproducibility, and very advantageous for the treatment of multiple lesions. Longer follow-up will be necessary to consolidate the long-term results.

September 15, 2020 ◆ Volume 102, Number 6 www.aafp.org/afp American Family Physician 339 Keratinocyte carcinoma, referred to as nonmelanoma skin cancer, comprises basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and cuta­ neous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC). BCC is the most common skin cancer malignancy and affects more than 3.3 million people annually in the United States.1 CSCC is the second most common skin cancer, with up to 400,000 U.S. cases and more than 3,000 disease-related deaths annually.2 Lifetime risk of keratinocyte carcinoma in the United States is at least 20% and is greater than 30% for White patients.3 Reported incidence rates of BCC vary depending on factors such as geographic latitude and sun exposure. Although BCCs can develop early in life, sporadically, and with certain genetic syndromes, age is an independent risk factor. The incidence of BCC increases after age 40. Inci­ dence in younger people is increasing and may be the result of increased sun exposure.4 The proportion of keratinocyte carcinomas represented by CSCC has increased to 30% or greater, primarily in older patients, and is attributed to cumulative ultraviolet light exposure.3 Risk Factors and Prevention Intermittent sun exposure (e.g., recreational tanning, occu­ pational exposure, childhood sunburns) is the predominant risk factor for BCC. Cumulative sun exposure plays a criti­ cal role in CSCC carcinogenesis. The presence of any nevus on an extremity is associated with a higher risk of BCC. One study found that people with 15 or more nevi on the extrem­ ities had a 40% greater likelihood of BCC compared with those without any nevi on the extremities. No association between nevus count and CSCC has been observed.5 Basal Cell and Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinomas:​ Diagnosis and Treatment Jonathon M.

Keratinocyte carcinoma, traditionally referred to as nonmelanoma skin cancer, includes basal cell and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and is the most common skin cancer malignancy found in humans. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends counseling about minimizing exposure to ultraviolet radiation for people aged six months to 24 years with fair skin types to decrease their risk of skin cancer. Routine screening for skin cancer is controversial. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force concludes that current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of a routine whole-body skin examination to screen for skin cancer. Basal cell carci­ noma commonly appears as a shiny, pearly papule with a smooth surface, rolled borders, and arborizing telangiectatic surface vessels. Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma commonly appears as a firm, smooth, or hyperkeratotic papule or plaque, and may have central ulceration. Initial tissue sampling for diagno­ sis is a shave technique if the lesion is raised, or a punch biopsy of the most abnormal-appearing area of skin. High-risk factors for recurrence and metas­ tasis include prior tumors, ill-defined borders, aggressive histologic patterns, and perineural invasion. Mohs micrographic surgery has the lowest recurrence rate among treatments but is best considered for large, high-risk tumors or tumors in sensitive anatomic locations. Smaller, lower-risk tumors are treated with surgical excision, electrodesiccation and curettage, or cryotherapy. Topical imiquimod and fluorouracil are also treatment options for superficial basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma in situ. There are no clear guidelines for follow up after an index keratinocyte carcinoma, but monitoring for recurrence is important because

basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma in situ. There are no clear guidelines for follow up after an index keratinocyte carcinoma, but monitoring for recurrence is important because the five-year risk of subsequent skin cancer is 41%. After more than one diagnosis, the five-year risk increases to 82%. (Am Fam Physician. 2020;​102(6):​339-346. Copyright © 2020 American Academy of Family Physicians.)

340 American Family Physician www.aafp.org/afp Volume 102, Number 6 ◆ September 15, 2020 CARCINOMAS In addition to cumulative sun exposure, other risk fac­ tors for CSCC include chronically diseased or injured skin (e.g., ulcers, sinus tracts), exposure to ionizing or ultravi­ olet B radiation, immunosuppression (including HIV and drug-induced immunosuppression following organ trans­ plantation), and xeroderma pigmentosum. Organ trans­ plant recipients are 65 times more likely to develop CSCC compared with age-matched control patients. Lesions appear an average of two to four years after transplantation with increasing frequency over time.6 The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) rec­ ommends behavior therapy aimed at minimizing exposure to ultraviolet radiation to decrease the risk of skin cancer for people aged six months to 24 years with fair skin types (i.e., ivory or pale skin, light eye color, red or blond hair, freckles, and those who sunburn easily). The USPSTF also recommends selective counseling for adults 25 years and older with fair skin types, noting that there is limited ben­ efit to counseling all adults. There is insufficient evidence to include people without a fair skin type in the recom­ mendation statement.7 The USPSTF stated the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms for counseling adults about skin self-examination and routine screen­ ing of healthy adults for skin cancer.8 A 2016 Cochrane review found no difference in the incidence of BCC or CSCC with daily sunscreen use com­ pared with occasional use.9 The sin­ gle randomized trial included in the review demonstrated a 39% reduction in the number of CSCC tumors in the group using sunscreen daily compared with the never-used group.10 No stud­ ies evaluated other sun-protection measures, including sun-protective clothing, sunglasses, or hats, or seek­ ing the shade when outdoors.9 Tanning bed use imparts a session-dependent increase in the risk of BCC, with a near-doubling of the risk if tanning bed use begins before age 24.11 Pathophysiology BASAL CELL CARCINOMA BCC develops from basal keratino­ cytes of the epidermis, hair follicles, and eccrine sweat ducts. BCC requires surrounding stroma for support during growth;​ therefore, the risk of metastasis by blood or lymphatics is less than 1%. BCC has two common histologic patterns:​ nodular (60% to 80%) and superficial (20%). Approximately 15% of BCCs exhibit a micronodular pattern, and less than 10% have morpheaform or sclerosing, desmoplastic, or infiltrative changes.12 A mixed pattern, containing two or more histo­ logic patterns, occurs in more than 40% of cases.13 CUTANEOUS SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA Actinic keratosis is the principal precursor to CSCC. Actinic keratosis and CSCC represent the same disease process at different stages of development, with neoplas­ tic transformation of epidermal keratinocytes commonly triggered by ultraviolet radiation.14 CSCC spreads by local infiltration and expansion, and may follow tissue planes and conduits, such as nerves and vessels. The aver­ age risk of nodal metastasis in CSCC is approximately 3%.15 The risk of metastasis increases in patients who are immunosuppressed.16 Estimates of the rate of malignant transformation of actinic keratosis to invasive CSCC vary widely, but may be as high as 20% per year.17 At least 60% of CSCC develop from lesions previously diagnosed as actinic keratoses, and there SORT:​ KEY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PRACTICE Clinical recommendation Evidence rating Comments Basal cell carcinoma and cutaneous squa­ mous cell carcinoma should be primarily treated with surgical excision.1 C Expert consensus High-risk tumors and tumors with more invasive histologic subtypes (micronodu­ lar, infiltrative, and morpheaform) are best treated with Mohs micrographic surgery.22 B Randomized trial com­ paring outcomes with standard excision to Mohs micrographic surgery Excision of basal cell carcinoma with pathology

September 15, 2020 ◆ Volume 102, Number 6 www.aafp.org/afp American Family Physician 341 CARCINOMAS is a clear association between the number of actinic keratosis lesions and the risk of malignant transformation. Although up to 50% of lesions spontaneously resolve over 12 months, actinic keratosis is a marker for invasive skin cancer.18 Clinical Presentation BASAL CELL CARCINOMA Eighty-five percent of all BCCs appear on the head and neck region.4 Nodular BCC has a variable presentation but typi­ cally is a shiny, pearly papule or nodule with a smooth sur­ face, rolled borders, and arborizing telangiectatic surface vessels (Figures 1A and 1B). Pigmented BCC typically has a nodular histologic pattern and contains melanin, which may give the lesion a blue, brown, or black color19 (Figure 2). Pigmented BCC may be mistaken for melanoma. Super­ ficial BCC is the least invasive of the subtypes and most commonly occur on the trunk and extremities (Figure 3). It appears as a thin scaly plaque resembling eczema or psoria­ sis, but often retains the characteristic raised, pearly borders of the nodular subtype. Micronodular and infiltrative BCCs are difficult to dif­ ferentiate clinically from superficial and nodular BCCs and can present as erythematous macules or thin papules or plaques. Micronodular changes often present with other A B FIGURE 1 Nodular basal cell carcinoma with (A) pearly papule with rolled borders, and (B) pearly pink borders, cen­ tral crusting, and superficial telangiectatic surface vessels.

Less than 10% of BCCs exhibit morpheaform or sclerosing changes that present as an infiltrated plaque with poorly defined borders, shiny surface, and may resemble a scar. These lesions are commonly found on the head and neck and are significantly more difficult to treat because of aggressive biologic behavior with local destruction and sub­ clinical extension, and higher local recurrence rates.12 The concordance between the subtype identified on a biopsy specimen vs. excision is 60% to 80%.12,20 Small biopsy specimens with a less worrisome superficial or nodular sub­ type may show a more aggressive micronodular or infiltra­ tive subtype in more than 25% of complete excisions.20 The most aggressive subtype guides management. CUTANEOUS SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA Actinic keratosis presents as a rough, scaly papule on an erythematous base, typically measuring 2 to 6 mm in diameter (Figure 4). The lesion is more easily recognized by palpation than by visual inspection. CSCC most com­ monly appears as a firm, smooth, or hyperkeratotic papule or plaque, often with central ulceration (Figures 5 and 6). Patients may describe a nonhealing lesion that bleeds with minimal trauma. Bowen disease (i.e., squamous cell carcinoma in situ) presents as a slowly growing, scaly, red plaque that typically appears on sun-exposed skin. A cutaneous horn may begin as actinic keratosis and degenerate into squamous cell car­ cinoma.21 Keratoacanthoma may be difficult to distinguish from CSCC and may contain CSCC at its base. Keratoac­ anthoma appears as a firm, rapidly growing, erythematous papule with a central keratotic plug (Figure 7). Although it may follow an indolent course, keratoacanthoma is best characterized as a malignant lesion and should be treated as CSCC. Table 1 summarizes and compares the charac­ teristics of BCC and CSCC.1,6 FIGURE 6 Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma with central keratosis suggestive of keratoacanthoma.

September 15, 2020 ◆ Volume 102, Number 6 www.aafp.org/afp American Family Physician 343 CARCINOMAS Diagnosis Multiple biopsy techniques are available for sampling lesions suspected to be carcinomas. Initial tissue sam­ pling is typically performed using a shave technique if the lesion is raised, or using a punch biopsy of the most abnormal-appearing skin. Complete excision may be an appropriate initial diagnostic procedure for smaller lesions. Pigmented lesions and those with any features concerning for melanoma risk should always be evaluated using a full-thickness technique. The Brigham and Women’s Hospital tumor classifica­ tion system can determine the stage of CSCC based on tumor risk factors. The eighth edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging manual adds nodal and metastasis classification, but the Brigham and Wom­ en’s Hospital system may provide superior prognostication for patients with localized CSCC.2 The National Compre­ hensive Cancer Network has developed a stratification framework that offers practical guidance for clinicians in distinguishing BCC and CSCC at low vs. high risk of recur­ rence (Table 2).1,2 Treatment BASAL CELL CARCINOMA Treatment of BCC with Mohs micrographic surgery has the lowest recurrence rate. However, because of cost and limited availability, it is best considered for larger tumors (i.e., greater than 2 cm on the trunk or extremities), more invasive histologic subtypes (i.e., micronodular, infiltra­ tive, and morpheaform), or tumors at sites with a higher risk of recurrence.22 The recurrence rate for tumors treated with Mohs surgery is 4.4% at 10 years, whereas standard surgical excision has a 12.2% recurrence rate at 10 years.23 The slow growth rate of BCC results in recurrences that are commonly diagnosed more than five years following defin­ itive treatment. BCC and CSCC are characterized by asymmetric sub­ clinical extension of the tumor beyond the clinically visible lesion. National Cancer Care Network guidelines recom­ mend the excision of low-risk primary BCC with a 4-mm margin of uninvolved skin around the tumor.1 Incomplete excision of the primary tumor (i.e., pathology demonstrat­ ing tumor at the surgical margin) should be followed by immediate reexcision or Mohs micrographic surgery because it is difficult to con­ trol recurrent BCC.24 Electrodesiccation and curettage is an appropri­ ate choice for low-risk pri­ mary, nonfibrosing tumors. Tumor recurrence rates at five years range from less than 2% to more than 20%, depending on lesion char­ acteristics and practitioner skill.25 Consider cryotherapy for low-risk BCC when more effective therapies are con­ traindicated or impractical. Biopsy should be performed before the procedure to determine tumor depth TABLE 1 Comparison of Basal Cell and Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma Characteristics Basal cell carcinoma Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma Patient age Uncommon in adults younger than 40;​ up to 20% of tumors occur in adults younger than 50 Uncommon in adults younger than 50 Patient characteristics Fair skin, blue eyes, red or light-colored hair, inability to tan Few, if any, identifiable phenotypic markers associated with high risk Tumor location Most tumors (85%) occur on the head and neck region, with 25% to 30% occurring on the nose;​ does not correlate well with areas of maximal sun exposure;​ approx­ imately one-third occur on areas that receive little or no ultraviolet exposure More common on the back of the hands and forearms;​ tumors on the head and neck are most common on areas that receive maximal sun exposure Ultraviolet light exposure Weaker association;​ exposure in child­ hood and adolescence more important Stronger association;​ cumulative exposure more important Information from references 1 and 6.

344 American Family Physician www.aafp.org/afp Volume 102, Number 6 ◆ September 15, 2020 CARCINOMAS because cryotherapy is not indicated for tumors that are more than 3-mm deep.26 Reported recurrence rates for cryosurgery range from less than 2% to up to 20%, depend­ ing on lesion characteristics and duration of follow-up.13 If surgical excision of BCC is not feasible, contrain­ dicated, or not preferred by the patient, radiotherapy is an additional treatment option. Radiotherapy requires multiple sessions, and postradiation changes can include dyspigmentation and radiodystrophy. Tumor recurrence postradiation may be more difficult to treat.22 Topical imiquimod (Aldara), an immunomodulator, is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of superficial BCC, but not for other BCC sub­ types. Rates of clinical and histologic cure at one year range from 60% to 80%. Monotherapy with topical fluorouracil, an antimetabolite, is also FDA-approved for the treatment of superficial BCC.27 These treatments are optimal for patients with small tumors in low-risk locations who are unable to tolerate more definitive therapies.1 CUTANEOUS SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA National Cancer Care Network guide­ lines recommend the excision of low- risk primary CSCC with a 4- to 6-mm margin of uninvolved skin around the tumor. Mohs micrographic surgery is an appropriate option for high-risk tumors or tumors in sensitive ana­ tomic locations. Electrodesiccation and curettage or cryotherapy may be considered for smaller, low-risk lesions. If surgical therapy is not feasi­ ble or preferred, consider radiotherapy when tumors are low risk;​ however, radiotherapy is associated with a lower cure rate. Additionally, postradiation cosmesis can worsen with time and radiotherapy is not usually considered for patients younger than 55.2 There is little evidence from ran­ domized controlled trials comparing the effectiveness of interventions for primary CSCC. Moderate-quality evidence supports the use of topical options (i.e., imiquimod, and fluoro­ uracil) for the treatment of CSCC in situ but are not approved by the FDA. Cryo­ surgery may be considered for low-risk CSCC when more effective therapies are contraindicated or impractical.4 Cryotherapy is the most appropri­ ate treatment for individual actinic keratosis lesions.

Complete clearance of actinic keratosis lesions is difficult to achieve and the goal of therapy is to decrease the absolute number of actinic keratosis lesions.18 Table 3 sum­ marizes the treatments for keratinocyte carcinomas.28 Follow-Up After diagnosis, screening of the patient for new primary skin cancers, including BCC, CSCC, and melanoma, should be performed at least once per year. A prospective cohort study found the five-year probability of a subsequent kera­ tinocyte carcinoma after a first diagnosis was 40.7%. After more than one diagnosis, the five-year risk probability increased to 82%.29 Initial diagnosis of keratinocyte carci­ noma also more than doubles the risk of subsequent malig­ nant melanoma.30 The article updates previous articles by the author,31 Stulberg, et al.,32 and Jerant, et al.33 Data Sources:​ Medline and the Cochrane Database of Sys­ tematic Reviews was searched for the key terms basal cell carcinoma, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, keratinocyte carcinoma;​ and with limits, humans, English language.

Multidisciplinary experts from European Association of Dermato-Oncology (EADO), European Dermatology Forum, European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology (ESTRO), Union Européenne des Médecins Spécialistes, and the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology developed updated recommendations on diagnosis and treatment of BCC. BCCs were categorised into ‘easy-to-treat’ (common) and ‘difficult-to- treat’ according to the new EADO clinical classification. Diagnosis is based on clinico-der­ matoscopic features, although histopathological confirmation is mandatory in equivocal le­ sions. The first-line treatment of BCC is complete surgery. Micrographically controlled surgery shall be offered in high-risk and recurrent BCC, and BCC located on critical ana­ tomical sites. Topical therapies and destructive approaches can be considered in patients with low-risk superficial BCC. Photodynamic therapy is an effective treatment for superficial and low-risk nodular BCCs. Management of ‘difficult-to-treat’ BCCs should be discussed by a multidisciplinary tumour board. Hedgehog inhibitors (HHIs), vismodegib or sonidegib, should be offered to patients with locally advanced and metastatic BCC. Immunotherapy with anti-PD1 antibodies (cemiplimab) is a second-line treatment in patients with a progression of disease, contraindication, or intolerance to HHI therapy. Radiotherapy represents a valid alternative in patients who are not candidates for or decline surgery, especially elderly pa­ tients. Electrochemotherapy may be offered when surgery or radiotherapy is contraindicated. In Gorlin patients, regular skin examinations are required to diagnose and treat BCCs at an early stage. Long-term follow-up is

order to guarantee the interdisciplinary character of these guidelines, they were developed in cooperation with the EDF), European SocieTy for Radiotherapy and Oncology (ESTRO), Union Européenne des Médecins Spécialistes (UEMS), and European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV). Thirty-two experts from 13 countries, all of which were delegates of national and/or international medical societies, colla­ borated in the development of these guidelines. 1.2. Financing of these guidelines The guidelines were supported by grants from the EADO for the guideline meetings. The authors did this work on a voluntary basis and did not receive any honorarium or reimbursement. Guidelines development group members stated their conflicts of interest in the relevant section. 1.3. Disclaimer Medicine is subject to a continuous development pro­ cess. This entails that all statements, especially regarding diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, can only reflect scientific knowledge current at the time of printing of these guidelines. Upmost care was applied with respect to stated therapeutic recommendations and selection as well as dosage of drugs. Nevertheless, users are prompted to use package inserts and expert information by the manufacturers as backup and, in case of doubt, consult a specialist. Pursuant to the public interest, questionable discrepancies shall be communicated to the GPO editors. The user remains responsible for all di­ agnostic and therapeutic applications, medications, and doses. Registered trademarks (protected product names) are not specified in these guidelines. From the absence of respective indications, it may thus not be inferred that product names are unprotected. This work is protected by copyright in all its parts. Any utilisation outside the provision of the copyright act without the written permission by the GPO of the EADO is prohibited and punishable by law. No part of this work may be reproduced in any way without written permission by the GPO. This applies in parti­ cular to duplications, translations, microfilming, sto­ rage, application, and utilisation in electronic systems, intranets, and internet. 1.4. Scope These guidelines were written to assist clinicians in diagnosis and treatment of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) patients. This update was initiated mainly due to the publication of a new clinical classification and implementation of novel advances in the diagnosis of BCC (non-invasive imaging techniques) and treatment (e.g. electrochemotherapy [ECT] and im­ munotherapy) of patients with difficult-to-treat BCC. The use of these guidelines in the clinical routine should improve patient care. 1.5. Target population The present guidelines contain recommendations re­ garding diagnosis, therapy, and follow-up of patients with BCC, addressing in detail all aspects of BCC management, from the common types of tumours to those which are ‘difficult-to-treat’ or ‘advanced.’ 1.6. Objectives The guidelines are developed primarily for those clin­ icians who are caring for patients with BCC. A new classification system is introduced based on ‘real- life’ scenarios of complex cases rather than a simple ‘stepwise’ prognostic model like TNM, which is less easily applicable to BCC. Emphasis is given on the evolving field of non-invasive imaging techniques for BCC diagnosis and systemic therapy for advanced BCC, for example, targeted therapy and immunotherapy. Prevention issues are also briefly addressed. 1.7. Audience and period of validity This set of guidelines will assist healthcare providers in managing their patients according to the current stan­ dards of care and evidence-based medicine. It is not intended to replace national guidelines accepted in their original country. These guidelines reflect the best-pub­ lished data available at the time the report was pre­ pared. Caution should be exercised in interpreting the data; results of future studies may modify conclusions or recommendations in this report. In

at the time the report was pre­ pared. Caution should be exercised in interpreting the data; results of future studies may modify conclusions or recommendations in this report. In addition, it may be necessary to deviate from these guidelines for in­ dividual patients or under special circumstances. Just as adherence to the guidelines may not constitute defence against a claim of negligence, deviation from them should not necessarily be deemed negligent. These guidelines will require updating approximately every 3 years (Expire date: December 2026) but advance in medical sciences may demand an earlier update. 1.8. Principles of methodology The guidelines published here are an update of the existing European consensus-based (EDF/EADO/EORTC) inter­ disciplinary guidelines for the management of BCC (former version 2019) [1] and based on other up-to-date guidelines, including the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology for BCC (version 1.2023) (https://www.nccn.org) and the British Association of Dermatologists guidelines for the manage­ ment of individuals with BCC 2021 [2].

15th March 2023. The methodology of these updated guidelines was based on the standards of the AGREE II instrument [3]. Recommendations are based on the level of best-quality available evidence and good clinical prac­ tice (GCP). The levels of evidence were graded according to the Oxford classification (Table 1). The grades of re­ commendation were classified as follows: A: Strong recommendation. Syntax: ‘shall.’ B: Recommendation. Syntax: ‘should.’ C: Weak recommendation. Syntax: ‘may/can.’ X: Should not be recommended. 0: Recommendation pending. Currently not available or not sufficient evidence to make a recommendation in favour or against. Expert consensus was provided wherever adequate evidence is not available. 1.9. Consensus-building process The consensus-building process was conducted as follows: in a first round, medical expert who participated in their na­ tional guidelines development processes was involved in producing an initial draft. In a second round, the selected experts from different specialties and different scientific so­ cieties (EADO, EDF, ESTRO, UEMS, EADV) contributed to these guidelines. A consensus meeting was held in Rome, Italy, on 25th November 2022, with final outcomes: (1) the approval of the text and (2) a consensus rate of agreement of at least 80%, for recommendations provided in structured boxes and the algorithm. Voting of the recommendations included the selection of ‘Agree,’ ‘Disagree,’ or ‘Abstential’ vote, and the possibility of providing comments. Thirty-two experts were present in the consensus meeting. The finali­ sation of the draught and recommendations was conducted among all coauthors through emailing in April 2023. 2. Definition BCC, a skin carcinoma derived from epidermal cells, is the most frequent malignant tumour in humans. Named for the optical similarity in appearance between the cells at the periphery of tumour islets to the cells of the basal layer of the epidermis, BCC is nowadays thought to arise from stem cells of the hair follicle [4–6]. It typically arises on sun-exposed sites of fair-skinned individuals with the head and neck region being the most common localisation. As chronic sun exposure is the most im­ portant carcinogen, the incidence of BCC is higher in elderly patients with a peak at around 80 years of age [7–9]. BCC most commonly presents as a slow growing, skin-coloured nodule with a pearly shiny appearance and arborising vessels visible on the tumour surface upon clinical or dermatoscopic inspection, with larger tumours showing central ulceration. Superficial BCC (sBCC) is another frequent subtype, mainly related to intermittent sun exposure and preferentially located on the trunk. Variants of BCC may present as pigmented tumours or sclerosing lesions in the presence of a more extensive stromal component. BCC has a very low propensity to metastasise with fewer than 1% of patients being affected, but it can progress to large, locally ad­ vanced, and often deeply infiltrating tumours if not early detected, mismanaged, or neglected [10,11]. 3. Epidemiology BCC accounts for about 75% of all keratinocyte can­ cers. The average lifetime risk for white-skinned in­ dividuals to develop BCC is approximately 30% [10]. The epidemiology of BCC is difficult to describe accu­ rately as routine recording of BCC is often not per­ formed by cancer registries, and not all BCC cases are sent for histopathological diagnosis [12]. In addition, because most cancer registries record only the first his­ topathologically confirmed BCC per patient, the true incidence of BCC may be significantly underestimated [13]. The increasing incidence of BCC has been reported in many countries all over the world as a result of changed sun-exposure behaviours and a general ageing population. There are large regional variations in re­ ported incidence rates of BCC due to the geographic location (latitude) of the study population, study period, and methods for registering BCC [14].

large regional variations in re­ ported incidence rates of BCC due to the geographic location (latitude) of the study population, study period, and methods for registering BCC [14]. The highest in­ cidence has been reported in Australia, followed by the United States (US) and Europe [15]. In Northern Eur­ opean countries, BCC incidence has been shown to in­ crease with age, with a more pronounced increase for women compared to men. Furthermore, a relatively higher incidence increase of BCC has been observed in young individuals compared to old individuals over time, especially for women [15,16]. In a recent analysis of the Swedish national registry (data from 2004 to 2017), the age-standardised person-based incidence rose from 308 per 100,000 in 2004 to 405 per 100,000 in 2017 [17]. In addition, aggressive BCC subtypes appear to be increasing faster than other subtypes [17]. A study on the incidence and trends of first and multiple BCCs in The Netherlands reported a decrease in annual in­ cidences of 3.6% for males and 3.0% for females aged 30–39 years [18]. For patients aged ≥50 years, an ever- increasing trend was found. Over the next 10 years, the incidence of BCC is expected to increase by 30-4% (males) and 25-3% (females). In a qualitative systematic review, no significant difference in risk for all-cause mortality has been reported in patients with a history of BCC [19]. Patients diagnosed with a first BCC have a remarkable increased risk of developing a second BCC and, less frequently, a squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) or melanoma. This elevated risk may vary geo­ graphically [20,21]. A very small percentage of patients with BCC de­ velop high-frequency BCC (HF-BCC) without associated K.

germline mutations and clinical phenotype of genetic syndromes. HF-BCC has been defined as ≥9 BCCs diag­ nosed over a 3-year period and associated with male sex and a history of SCC and melanoma. Patients with HF- BCC also have an increased risk of lymphoma, leukaemia, breast, and colon cancer [22–24]. Advanced BCC includes locally advanced BCC (laBCC) and metastatic BCC (mBCC). A retrospective US cohort study reported that laBCC accounts for 0.8% of all BCC cases (age-adjusted incidence rate: 1.83 per 100,000 persons, which is projected to 4399 cases in the US population). Rates of aBCC were highest for pa­ tients older than 65 years and for males [25]. Histolo­ gically confirmed mBCCs are extremely rare, with an estimated incidence of 0.0028–0.55% [26]. In a retro­ spective analysis of a tertiary referral centre, 0.6% of BCCs were classified as severe, including BCC in­ appropriate for surgery or radiotherapy, mBCC, or BCC requiring extensive treatment [27]. However, the real incidence, prevalence, and mortality of mBCC are still underestimated since staging examinations were not routinely performed in the past and registers of ad­ vanced BCC have been recently introduced. 4. Aetiology and genetics Different hypotheses have been formulated on the cell of origin of BCC. Whereas most BCCs seem to arise from stem cells of the hair follicle [5,6], some authors contend that BCC stem cells are located in the interfollicular epidermis and infundibulum and not in the hair bulge [4]. It has been suggested that, depending on the carci­ nogenic agent involved, different stem cell compart­ ments may be targeted and subsequently give rise to BCC. Notably, BCC cell lines have not been easily de­ veloped, suggesting that their isolation and proliferation require unidentified environmental or cellular factors. The main carcinogenic factor is ultraviolet light (UV), which explains why most tumours are located on sun-ex­ posed sites. Indeed, BCC is one of the most highly mutated human tumours (i.e. tumour mutational burden [TMB] is 65 mutations/megabases, compared with 14 mutations/ megabases for melanoma) [28,29] and harbours a large percentage of UV-induced mutations (C:T or CC:TT transitions at dipyrimidine sites) [30]. In addition, indoor tanning (sunbeds, solarium) has been associated with a higher risk of skin cancers including BCC, with a dose-re­ sponse relationship [31–33]. Other causal environmental carcinogens include ionising radiation and arsenic. Light pigmentary characteristics (fair skin colour, red hair, blue eyes), increasing age, immunodeficiency (including iatro­ genic immunosuppression, HIV, and haematological ma­ lignancies) are also important aetiological factors. MC1R gene variants have been shown to modulate pigmentation characteristics and to be associated with a higher risk of developing sporadic BCC, with an OR (95% confidence interval [CI]) of 1.39 (1.15–1.69) [34]. BCCs are usually sporadic tumours and, at the ge­ netic level, the main pathogenetic driver is the activation of the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway with inactivating mu­ tations of PTCH1 on chromosome 9q22.3 identified in about 90% of sporadic BCCs and activating mutations of SMO in approximately 10%. Alterations of the Hh pathway are also found in other Hh-dependent tumours such as medulloblastoma and neuroblastoma [35]. All of these tumours may develop in patients with Gorlin syndrome, a rare genetic disorder predisposing to mul­ tiple BCCs, due to germline mutations in PTCH1 and, less frequently, in PTCH2, SMO, and SUFU. A small percentage of BCCs have no mutations in the Hh pathway. Other driver mutations have also been found in cancer-related genes such as MYCN, PPP6C, STK19, LATS1, ERBB2, PIK23C, N-RAS, K-RAS, and H- RAS, and loss of function of PTPN14, RB1, and FBXW7. Mutations in the P53 gene are frequently ob­ served [30]. However, to date, no genetic profile has been associated with a specific histopathological sub­ type. Changes in the Hippo pathway

Mutations in the P53 gene are frequently ob­ served [30]. However, to date, no genetic profile has been associated with a specific histopathological sub­ type. Changes in the Hippo pathway are also implicated in BCC development, including upregulation of the transcriptional activators YAP1 and Taz [36]. Genetic changes may underlie the resistance of a subset of patients to Hedgehog inhibitors (HHIs). Primary resistance of BCCs may occur by the activation of non-canonical Hh pathways or signalling through additional pathways. Recently, it has been reported that HHI primary resistant BCCs share molecular abnorm­ alities common to secondary resistant tumours (muta­ tions in SMO and MYCN), are highly rearranged, and have activation of the Hippo-Yap and WNT pathways [37]. Secondary HHI resistance is explained by muta­ tions in SMO either impairing drug binding or acti­ vating SMO at different levels. In addition, copy number changes in SUFU and Gli2 have been observed in secondary resistant tumours [28,29]. BCC is also characterised by a low immunogenicity due to the downregulation of proteins involved in an­ tigen modification and presentation, such as transpor­ ters associated with antigen processing-1 (TAP-1) and major histocompatibility complex I (MHC-I), and to diminished infiltration by CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells with an increased presence of regulatory T-cells (T-regs), and immunosuppressive effects driven by IL-10 and Th2 cytokines [38,39]. In addition to Gorlin syndrome, other genetic dis­ eases also predispose to the development of BCC (Table 2). Among these, xeroderma pigmentosum is due to germline mutations in DNA nucleotide excision re­ pair genes [40]. Patients develop multiple tumours, in­ cluding BCC and also melanoma and cutaneous SCC, often at an early age. Bazex–Dupré–Christol syndrome is an X-linked dominant genodermatosis characterised by follicular atrophoderma, congenital hypotrichosis, hypohidrosis, facial milia, and multiple BCCs [41] and is associated with small tandem noncoding intergenic K.

duplications at chromosome Xq26.1, which are likely to dysregulate ARHGAP36 [42]. Oley syndrome, a possible X-linked variant of Bazex–Dupré–Christol syndrome, and Rombo syndrome, with an uncertain genetic basis, are further rare genodermatoses associated with BCC [43]. BCCs may develop in other genodermatoses, in­ cluding disorders of melanin biosynthesis (oculocuta­ neous albinism and Hermansky–Pudlak syndrome), DNA replication/repair (Bloom, Werner, Roth­ mund–Thomson, and Muir–Torre syndromes), immune response (cartilage-hair hypoplasia and epidermodys­ plasia verruciformis), and genodermatoses affecting the folliculosebaceous structures (Cowden and Schöpf–Schulz–Passarge). 5. New EADO classification and staging: common and difficult-to-treat BCC The natural history of a BCC is usually that of a slow- growing skin cancer starting from a tiny papule, growing for years without any aggressiveness into a nodule or a plaque, sometimes ulcerated, leaving time to be diagnosed and managed correctly. A few clinical forms of common BCC, such as super­ ficial, nodular, morpheic, and ulcerated (ulcus rodens), are recognised. However, common BCCs are highly poly­ morphic and sometimes difficult to classify into one of these subtypes. BCCs should not be mistakenly regarded as ‘in­ dolent cancers,’ a reputation which they deserve only when they are treated early and adequately. Destructive growth and invasion of surrounding tissues usually occur while the rate of metastasis is very low. If BCC lesions are not treated for years or relapse several times after surgery, they become progressively ‘locally advanced.’ ‘Advanced’ BCC is a term that was introduced when patients who were not candidates for surgery and radiotherapy were sought for studies with targeted HHIs. Although not clearly defined, the word ‘advanced’ usually implies that (1) there has been a long history without treatment and/or repeated failures of treatments or recurrences, (2) there is extensive tissue de­ struction in the surrounding anatomical area, and (3) it has become difficult or impossible to cure the tumour with standard surgery (unresectable) or radiotherapy. We recently introduced a more pragmatic and op­ erational classification for BCC into ‘easy-to-treat’ BCC, which includes the most common BCC, and ‘difficult-to-treat’ BCC [44,45]. More than 90% of BCCs are easy to treat through standard surgery or a range of alternative blind treatments during the initial months or years after diagnosis. Difficult-to-treat BCCs include ‘all laBCCs’ and common BCCs which, for any reason, pose specific management difficulties. These reasons may be (1) the technical difficulty of maintaining function and aesthetics due to the size or location (eyes, nose, lips, and ears) of the tumour; (2) the poorly defined borders often associated with morpheic subtype or recurrence; (3) multiple recurrences on the face (often requiring much larger excision); (4) prior radiotherapy; (5) pa­ tient’s reluctance to accept the consequences of surgery; and (6) patient’s comorbidities interfering with surgery. Difficult-to-treat BCCs are quite heterogeneous with increasing difficulty of treatment and increasing risk of recurrence. The five-group EADO classification de­ scribes five different practical patterns, namely (1) common BCCs which are difficult to treat for any reason linked to the tumour (e.g. location requiring technical skills, poorly defined borders, prior recur­ rence) and/or to the patient (poor general status, co­ morbidities, unwillingness to cooperate); (2) BCCs difficult to treat because of the number of lesions; (3) large and/or destructive tumours out of critical areas; (4) large and/or destructive tumours in critical or func­ tionally significant areas (nose, periorificial) and (5) giant and/or deeply invasive tumours involving extra­ cutaneous tissue [44,45] (Fig. 1). Regarding staging, BCCs do not follow the three-step process, that is, tumour, nodal involvement, and

The five patterns of clinical situations were used as a basis to generate a four-stage classification covering the whole spectrum of BCCs, from the common easy-to- treat tumours up to the very rare metastatic cases (Fig. 1) [45]. EADO-stage I includes most of the BCCs, which are easy-to-treat and low risk. EADO-stage II comprises common BCC considered difficult-to-treat for any reasons linked to the patient or tumour (stage IIA) and BCCs considered difficult-to-treat because of their number (stage IIB). Stage III encompasses large and destructive tumours out of (stage IIIA) or on (stage IIIB) critical/functional areas and extremely destructive tumours (stage IIIC). Finally, stage IV refers to mBCCs. The prognostic value of this classification has not been demonstrated and will have to be assessed prospectively, bearing in mind that progression-free survival or overall survival curves are not meaningful for these tumours, which are not measurable by response evaluation cri­ teria in solid tumours (RECIST) criteria, and can de­ stroy large anatomic areas without affecting survival. 5.1. Definition of low- and high-risk BCC BCC can also be classified according to the risk of re­ currence into low and high risk (2, htpps://www.nccn. org). All difficult-to-treat BCCs are at high risk of re­ currence mainly because of difficulty in the management that often leads to compromise with regard to ideal treatment and recommended safety margins of excision. Most easy-to-treat BCCs are at low risk of recurrence. However, some apparently easy-to-treat BCCs may still be at risk of recurrences such as those located on the H area of the face, those with aggressive histological characteristics (perineural and/or perivascular involve­ ment), and those in immunosuppressed patients. All BCCs managed by ablative procedures without histo­ pathological control instead of surgical excision could be considered at high risk of recurrence. It must how­ ever be mentioned that not all recurrences have the same implications. A recurrence of an invasive BCC on the eyelids, nose, lips, and ears significantly increases the risk of deleterious consequences, whereas a recurrence of an sBCC on the back will be easily managed. 6. Diagnosis 6.1. Clinical and dermatoscopic diagnosis BCC most commonly clinically occurs as a pink/reddish, pearly, or translucent papule, plaque, or nodule with arborising vessels visible on the tumour surface and may appear pigmented exhibiting a brown, black, or bluish colouration. It has a slow progressive course, and, in time, central ulceration may occur. In the case of Fig. 1. EADO classification and staging for BCC.

infiltrative or morpheic BCCs, they may resemble a flat or atrophic scar-like lesion. In a systematic review of studies on BCC diagnosis, naked eye examination had a sensitivity of 66.9% and specificity of 97.2% that in­ creased to 85.0% and 98.2%, respectively, with the ad­ dition of dermatoscopy. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of dermatoscopy for the diagnosis of BCC were 91.2% and 95.0%, respectively, and were higher for pigmented than non-pigmented BCC. Sensitivity in­ creased when dermatoscopy was performed by experts and when the diagnosis was based on in-person der­ matoscopy as opposed to dermatoscopic photographs [46]. The main value of dermatoscopy is in the differ­ ential diagnosis of BCC with melanoma, SCC including Bowen’s disease, and benign tumours. However, the BCC subtype has to be assessed histopathologically in equivocal lesions [47]. Dermatoscopic criteria for BCC are branching and linear vessels (arborising and superficial telangiectasias), multiple erosions, ulceration, bluish-grey clods of vari­ able size (ovoid nests, globules, and focused dots), radial lines connected to a common base (leaf-like areas), ra­ dial lines converging to a central dot or clod (spoke- wheel areas), clods within a clod (concentric structures), and structureless white areas (porcelain structures, white crossing lines, or white clods (Fig. 2, Table 3) [48]. Re­ cently, multiple aggregated yellow-white globules have been described as a new diagnostic dermatoscopic fea­ ture of BCC particularly in high-risk subtypes on the head and neck [49]. It has been shown that individuals with multiple BCCs will exhibit a prevailing signature pattern among their tumours [50]. In a systematic review analysing 31 studies including 5950 BCCs, the most common dermatoscopic features detected in BCC were arborising vessels (59%), shiny white structures (49%), and large blue–grey ovoid nests (34%). However, the frequency of these criteria depends on the subtype [51]. The nodular subtype of BCC presents clinically as a reddish to skin-coloured, sometimes translucent papule, nodule, or plaque, most commonly located on the head/ neck area. The most striking dermatoscopic features are branching, focused vessels (arborising vessels, consisting of focused, bright red large stem vessels with multiple fine ramifications) [48,52]. In pigmented tumours, bluish-grey clods of variable size are also commonly observed. sBCC presents as scaly erythematous patch or plaque that usually is well demarcated and is typically located on the trunk and lower extremities. Often, multiple le­ sions are present. Dermatoscopically, it exhibits white to pinkish-red structureless areas, multiple small erosions and, if any, small focused linear vessels mainly at the border [53]. In pigmented lesions, the presence of radial lobules connected to a common base (leaf-like areas), radial lines converging to a central dot or clod (spoke-wheel areas), and clods within a clod (concentric structure) facilitate the diagnosis. Using polarised dermatoscopy, the presence of short white lines (chry­ salis structures) represents an additional feature for the diagnosis of sBCC [46]. Importantly, the presence of bluish-grey clods and branching linear vessels are ne­ gative predictors for the diagnosis of sBCC [54]. Morpheic BCC presents as a reddish plaque or a scar-like area with ill-defined borders. Upon dermato­ scopy, white structureless areas and fine arborising vessels are the most common structures. Ulceration is usually not present [55]. Basosquamous carcinoma typically appears as an ul­ cerated, facial nodule or plaque in elderly males with photodamaged skin [56]. Dermatoscopically, these tu­ mours may exhibit overlapping features of both BCC and invasive SCC, including unfocused (peripheral) arborising vessels, keratin masses, white structureless areas, super­ ficial scales, ulceration or blood crusts, blue–grey blotches, and blood spots in keratin masses [57].

invasive SCC, including unfocused (peripheral) arborising vessels, keratin masses, white structureless areas, super­ ficial scales, ulceration or blood crusts, blue–grey blotches, and blood spots in keratin masses [57]. Clinical diagnosis confirmed on dermatoscopy without histopathological examination is acceptable for the small nodular subtype on typical locations such as the head/neck or trunk, for the superficial subtypes lo­ cated on the trunk and extremities, and for multiple BCCs in Gorlin syndrome. However, in cases of suspi­ cious lesions on the face or when the tumour exhibits features associated with aggressive forms, biopsy and histopathology are recommended. In addition to clinical diagnosis, dermatoscopy has also been found to be a useful tool in the preoperative prediction of the BCC subtype and in the non-invasive assessment of tumour response to topical treatments [54,58,59]. 6.2. Other non-invasive imaging techniques Additional non-invasive skin-imaging tools that have been shown to be of high diagnostic value in derma­ toscopically equivocal tumours are reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM), optical coherence tomography (OCT), and line-field confocal (LC)-OCT, which are often only accessible in specialised skin cancer centres [60–62]. RCM allows the recognition of BCC in equi­ vocal lesions with a high sensitivity and specificity [63]. In a meta-analysis, RCM showed a sensitivity estimate of 0.97 (95% CI, 0.90–0.99) and a specificity estimate of 0.93 (95% CI, 0.88–0.96) for BCC diagnosis [64]. A re­ cent prospective, randomised multicentre study showed non-inferiority of in vivo RCM for diagnosing and subtyping BCC before surgery versus standard care (planned excision based on the histopathological diag­ nosis and subtype of a punch biopsy) for surgical treatment in patients with clinically suspected BCC [65]. RCM has been used to monitor the response to non- surgical treatments in sBCC and in multiple BCCs in the context of genodermatosis [66,67]. OCT has unique advantages such as margin de­ tection (deep and lateral), speed, and large field of K. Peris et al. / European Journal of Cancer 192 (2023) 113254 9

view. It may enable streamlined management in se­ lected cases of BCC and better selection of treatment modalities (surgical versus non-surgical) [68]. In a meta-analysis, it was shown that OCT improves the sensitivity and specificity when compared with visual inspection plus dermatoscopy in clinically challenging lesions [69]. In a multicentre prospective study, OCT allowed discrimination of sBCC from non-sBCC and non-BCC lesions with a detection rate of 97.8% for BCC. Subtyping without the need for biopsy was possible in 44% of the patients with a predictive value for the diagnosis of sBCC of 84.3% versus 98.8% for non-sBCC [70]. In addition, OCT-guided diagnosis was shown to be non-inferior to regular punch biopsy for the diagnosis of BCC in a multicentre randomised trial [71]. The combination of RCM and OCT (LC- OCT) may enable accurate diagnosis and depth as­ sessment in lesions clinically suggestive of BCC, identification of key histopathological features of in­ filtrative BCC, and presurgical evaluation aiding in the assessment of margins and tumour depth before Mohs micrographic surgery [72–74]. LC-OCT com­ bines the advantages of RCM with cellular resolution to 400 μm of depth and those of OCT such as 3-Di­ maging of the tissue with vertical and horizontal sections.

for which the diagnosis is uncertain. Furthermore, high- risk BCCs require histopathological diagnosis to assess the surgical margins. Multiple biopsies are re­ commended in laBCC to confirm the histopathological subtype. In the case of low-risk subtypes, non-invasive imaging techniques may be sufficient to confirm the diagnosis, especially when the tumour is scheduled for topical or destructive treatments. Incisional biopsy is indicated to confirm recurrences after surgery or de­ structive or topical treatments in low-risk subtypes. Histopathological subtypes of BCC stratified by the risk of recurrence described in the current WHO clas­ sification include [79] (1) lower risk: nodular, superficial, pigmented, infundibulocystic (a variant of BCC with adnexal differentiation), fibroepithelial; (2) higher risk: basosquamous carcinoma, sclerosing/morpheic, in­ filtrating, BCC with sarcomatoid differentiation, mi­ cronodular. Mixed forms of these subtypes are frequently found as well as collision tumours with SCC. Differential diagnosis with SCC can be difficult: im­ munohistochemical markers such as the Ber-EP4 anti­ body (marker for BCC) and the epithelial membrane antigen (EMA, marker for SCC) are very helpful. This applies in particular to the assessment of excision mar­ gins in micrographic surgery and the differentiation between benign follicular hyperplasia and parts of BCCs. A recent position paper of experts proposed a simplified histopathological classification unifying sclerosing, infiltrating, and micronodular BCCs into a single ‘infiltrative’ BCC subtype [80]. The histopathological report should include sub­ type, lateral and deep margin status, presence or absence of perineural invasion, and angiolymphatic invasion. 7. Staging work up On clinical presentation, a detailed medical history should be collected and physical examination, with an emphasis on complete skin examination, be performed. Total body skin examination is recommended because patients with BCC have a high risk of developing ad­ ditional skin tumours, both keratinocyte carcinomas and melanoma [81]. Imaging studies are not needed in patients with low- risk BCC. For advanced BCC, the imaging modality is chosen based on site and suspected extent of the disease (i.e. local, regional, metastatic) after a discussion in the multidisciplinary team. If soft-tissue involvement or perineural disease is suspected, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast is preferred whereas, if bone disease is suspected, Computed tomography with or without contrast is preferred. 8. Management of common (easy-to-treat and difficult- to-treat) BCC 8.1. Surgery Most primary BCCs can be easily treated by surgery or by non-surgical methods for certain subtypes. However, BCCs with a high risk of recurrence need to be treated more aggressively. The risk of recurrence mainly in­ creases with tumour size, localisation on the facial H- zone, aggressive histopathological subtype, previous recurrences, or long-term immunosuppression. Certain tumours can be locally advanced with the destruction of adjacent tissues or difficult to treat for other reasons, which might need discussion in a multidisciplinary board regarding appropriate therapy. Fig. 3 illustrates the EADO treatment algorithm. Surgical excision is a very effective treatment for primary BCC. Scalpel excision is performed using either a standard excision (2D) with safety margins or a mi­ crographically controlled stepwise procedure (3D). Recurrence rates largely depend on excisional techni­ ques and vary from < 1% to 8% at 5 years after surgery with best outcomes reported for micrographically con­ trolled surgery [82–85]. Surgical removal by destructive (blind) treatments and non-surgical modalities (topical treatments or photodynamic therapy [PDT]) can be used for low- risk BCCs when surgery is contraindicated or im­ practical. However, a higher risk of treatment failure has been reported with destructive or non-surgical

techniques. Moreover, deeper parts of tumours might not be reached because of methodology-inherent pe­ netration limits (e.g. PDT) or only with an in­ appropriate risk of tissue scarring (e.g. deep cryotherapy). As a rule, blind techniques should be avoided in BCCs in which a deeper tissue invasion cannot be ruled out and in those at increased risk for subclinical spread or local recurrence. 8.1.1. Standard excision with 2D histology The purpose of surgical therapy is to eliminate both the clinically apparent tumour and its microscopic exten­ sion into normal-appearing skin. Standard removal of BCC therefore includes the circumferential excision of all visible tumour borders together with an adequate adjacent safety margin of clinically uninvolved tissue.

and between 5 mm and 15 mm in high-risk lesions [2,87,88]. In addition to other factors (e.g. primary or recurrent lesion, histopathological subtype, presence or absence of perineural invasion), tumour size is crucial in predicting the risk of subclinical extension. A meta- analysis including 16,066 lesions demonstrated a 3-mm surgical margin to be safe in achieving a 95% cure rate for non-morpheaform lesions ≤2 cm [89]. A tumour of 2 cm with additional high-risk features would require a safety margin of at least 13 mm to achieve the same relative certainty of complete removal [90]. In clinically well-defined pigmented common BCCs, margins of only 2–3 mm have been shown to yield a removal rate of 99% [91,92]. Smaller margins may also be considered in sites where reconstructive options are limited and subsequent reconstruction is intended in a setting of micrographic (3D) surgery [60,93]. Guidelines addressing the deep margins recommend an excision up to subcutaneous tissue and in lesions on the head, down to the level of the fascia, perichondrium, or periosteum [2,87]. The use of non-invasive techniques (dermatoscopy, RCM, OCT, LC-OCT) has been investigated to define the preoperative margins more precisely and to detect tumours outside the clinically visible borders, particu­ larly in non-pigmented ill-defined BCC lesions [60,94]. However, implementation in clinical practice still needs further studies. 8.1.2. Re-excision after histologically narrow margins Clinical and histopathological margins do not necessa­ rily correspond. This might be due to the fact that tu­ mour infiltration, which is not clinically visible, may extend within the area of the surrounding safety margins and to the shrinkage of excised tissue after fixation for histopathological examination. Although shrinkage is less in aged and elastotic skin, a percentage shrinkage of 17−20% in length and about 10% in width can be ex­ pected [95,96]. Nevertheless, there are currently no data supporting the need for re-excision in the event of a complete excision with histologically narrow margins. 8.1.3. Micrographically controlled surgery Micrographically controlled surgery (3D histology with different possible approaches of examining vertical and/ or horizontal planes) best enables the complete ex­ amination of surgical margins. It represents a safe and proven method to confirm thorough resection of infiltrating tumours, especially at problematic sites, while preserving the adjacent tissue. This provides aes­ thetic results that are superior or equivalent to non- surgical and less safe procedures [97]. Micrographically controlled surgery is both an efficient and cost-effective procedure providing the highest cure rates [98]. In a prospective randomised trial comparing standard 2D excision with micrographic 3D surgery, the 10-year cu­ mulative probability of recurrence for primary BCC was 12.2% after standard excision and 4.4% after micro­ graphically controlled surgery (p = 0.100). For recurrent BCCs, the cumulative 10-year recurrence probability was 13.5% and 3.9% for 2D and 3D excision, respec­ tively (p = 0.023) [99]. Apart from a higher risk of in­ complete excision with an increased likelihood of recurrence, standard 2D excision and reconstruction might result in more invasive or cosmetically less de­ sirable reconstruction compared to 3D excision [100,101]. Primary BCCs associated with a high risk of local recurrence or subclinical extension and those in cosmetically or functionally sensitive locations, as the central face, or BCCs exhibiting aggressive growth patterns are candidates for a stepwise surgery with 3D histology (if technically available) [97,102–105]. In ad­ dition, recurrent tumours should undergo micro­ scopically controlled surgery because the cure rates for recurrent BCCs are inferior to those of primary lesions with a reported re-recurrence rate at 5 years between 11.6% and 17.4% [106,107].

to those of primary lesions with a reported re-recurrence rate at 5 years between 11.6% and 17.4% [106,107]. In 174 recurrent BCC le­ sions of the head and neck treated with micrographic surgery, the recurrence rate was only 4.6% with a cal­ culated 5-year cumulative probability of re-recurrence of 2.9% [108]. 8.1.4. Procedure in the event of incomplete excision Incomplete excision, where one or more surgical mar­ gins still contain neoplastic cells, has been reported in 4.7–24% of excisions and is influenced by surgical ex­ perience, anatomical site, histopathological subtype of tumour, and excision of multiple lesions during one procedure [109–113]. A recent meta-analysis comprising 106,832 BCCs, reported an overall proportion of in­ complete excisions of 11% with the lowest numbers for patients treated by dermatologists (6.2%) [114]. Recur­ rence after surgery of incompletely excised BCC ranges from 26% to 41% after 2–5 years of follow-up, and the maximum number of tumour recurrences has been Box 22 Follow-up.

detected in BCC series with a predominance of the morpheic type [109]. The absence of residual tumour cells in the surgical specimen can be observed in about half of the BCCs after re-excision because of positive surgical margins. However, the risk of further re­ currences among tumours that have already recurred once is more than 50%, especially when both lateral and deep margins are involved [111]. Some incompletely excised lesions may demonstrate a more aggressive his­ topathological subtype when the lesion recurs [115]. Therefore, retreatment is suggested in aggressive tu­ mours prone to high recurrence rates (e.g. micronodular or multifocal tumours) or those in which the deep sur­ gical margins are involved, particularly when they are located in the midface or other complicated sites [109]. Micrographically controlled surgery (3D) should be considered in the latter situations. In a setting of mi­ crographically controlled (3D) surgery, re-excision in the presence of a positive margin is part of the stepwise procedure. Lesions with surgical margins that are tan­ gential or extremely close to the tumour should be managed as incompletely excised. Radiotherapy should be considered in patients with a high risk of not having a complete resection with surgery. Finally, clinical follow- up could also be considered for non-aggressive, small (< 2 cm) lesions on the trunk. 8.2. Destructive therapies Destructive therapies with curettage, electrocautery (electrodesiccation), cryosurgery (also referred to as cryotherapy), and laser ablation are therapeutic options for low-risk superficial and nodular BCCs. Curettage allows histopathological assessment, which is not pos­ sible with cryotherapy or laser ablation due to tissue destruction. Curettage ± electrodesiccation are treatment options suggested for low-risk primary BCCs, although there is no international consensus regarding the optimal protocol [116]. Efficacy is highly dependent on tumour character­ istics, anatomical location, and operator skills. The overall reported 5-year recurrence rates vary from 3% to 20% with lower recurrence rates for low-risk lesions located on the trunk and extremities. High recurrence rates are reported for facial and recurrent BCC and for BCCs on terminal hair-bearing skin [116,117]. No significant differences re­ garding surgical complications, postoperative recovery, aesthetic appearance, and patient satisfaction were recently found in patients with superficial, < 1 cm BCC, treated with curettage and electrodesiccation compared to those treated with conventional surgery, as assessed three months after the procedure [118]. Randomised clinical trials (RCTs) comparing cryo­ therapy with several other treatment modalities (PDT, surgery, radiotherapy) have reported recurrence rates for cryotherapy ranging from 6% at 1 year to 39% after 2 years of follow-up [119,120]. A single-centre, randomised, controlled non-inferiority trial demonstrated high tumour clearance rates of both curettage alone (95.7%) and cryo­ surgery (100%) for treatment of superficial, 5–20 mm BCCs on non-facial areas after 1 year, though the non- inferiority analysis was inconclusive [121]. An RCT of 240 patients compared clinical complete response rates of limb and trunk sBCCs treated with surgery, cryotherapy, and carbon dioxide (CO2) laser ablation: surgery was found to be more effective in comparison to the other treatments, whereas the com­ plete response rates with CO2 laser and cryotherapy were statistically not significant [120]. CO2, erbium yttrium aluminium garnet (Er:YAG), and neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (Nd:YAG) lasers ablate tissue through the vaporisa­ tion of tissue water, either in full ablative or fractional mode [122,123]. Tissue interaction and efficacy rates depend on operator settings, and there are no standard operational procedures. A few studies have evaluated the efficacy of laser ablation for the treatment of BCC, mainly as pretreatment before

operator settings, and there are no standard operational procedures. A few studies have evaluated the efficacy of laser ablation for the treatment of BCC, mainly as pretreatment before PDT, and no data are available on long-term follow-up [124–126]. Results from an RCT including 39 patients showed a higher rate of complete responses at 3 months and a lower rate of local relapses at 12 months in patients with small primary nodular BCCs treated with Er:Yag laser combined with ablative fractional laser (AFL)-PDT compared to patients treated with methyl aminolevu­ linate (MAL)-PDT [122]. Treatment with long-pulsed Nd:YAG laser showed promising results in 11 patients with nodular BCC and sBCC after a mean follow-up of 9 months (range 6–15 months) with minimal scarring and no long-term adverse events [127]. Similarly, good results in tumour clearance and recurrence rates have been reported in 102 patients with primary and re­ current BCCs treated with Nd:YAG laser, as assessed 2 months and 1 year after treatment evaluated using OCT. Only one treatment was sufficient for small le­ sions (< 5 mm), while larger lesions usually required more treatment sessions [128]. In 31 patients, long- pulsed 1064 nm Nd:YAG laser was used in non-ag­ gressive BCCs, less than 16 mm in size, located on the trunk or extremities, with complete histopathological clearance of the tumour in 90% of the lesions at 1 month [129]. However, incomplete tumour clearance was detected in 31% of 78 BCCs 3 months after treatment with Nd:YAG laser with a large number of side-effects and poor cosmetic outcome [130]. 8.3.

approved for sBCC, namely imiquimod 5% and 5% 5- fluorouracil (5-FU). 8.3.1. Imiquimod Imiquimod is an immune response modifier indicated for the treatment of sBCC in immunocompetent adults, applied once daily, five times per week for 6 weeks. A non-inferiority, RCT compared imiquimod 5% cream (once daily, five times a week for 6 weeks) with 5% 5-FU (twice daily for 4 weeks) and MAL-PDT (two sessions with an interval of 1 week) in patients with sBCC followed up for 5 years [131–133]. The overall estimate of treatment success at 1 year was 83.4% for imiquimod, 80.1% for 5% 5-FU, and 72.8% for MAL- PDT, supporting that topical 5% 5-FU was non-inferior and imiquimod 5% was superior to MAL-PDT for treatment of sBCC [131]. Tumour thickness and adnexal extension of sBCC appeared not to predict treatment failure [134]. Five-years after treatment, the probability of tumour-free survival was 80.5% for imiquimod, 70.0% for 5% 5-FU, and 62.7% for MAL-PDT, con­ firming that imiquimod 5% is superior to both MAL- PDT and 5% 5-FU in the treatment of patients with primary sBCC [133]. Limited evidence is available on the efficacy of imiquimod for BCC of the nodular type. In a recent systematic review on the efficacy of imi­ quimod for the treatment of nodular BCC, imiquimod showed 77.4% clinical and 72.9% histopathological clearance rates for nodular BCC, with a recurrence rate of 1.8% after an average follow-up of 13.0 months [135]. The efficacy of imiquimod 5% cream versus surgical excision was assessed in patients with low-risk super­ ficial and nodular BCC, once daily for 6 weeks (super­ ficial) or 12 weeks (nodular), with a successful response in 84% and 98% of the patients (p < 0.0001), respec­ tively, at 3 years from the start of treatment [136]. The 5- year follow-up data of this trial were comparable to the 3-year data, reporting maintenance of the clinical benefit in 82.5% of imiquimod-treated patients versus 97.7% of the surgery group (p < 0.001) [137]. Local erythema, swelling, erosion, crusting, irritation, and itching are often reported as moderate or severe in patients treated with imiquimod. Approximately 5% of treated patients also experience systemic flu-like symptoms [131]. Imi­ quimod represents a clinically useful alternative to sur­ gery in the treatment of low-risk, single or multiple sBCC [138]. Combination therapies with curettage or cryotherapy have been reported, but they need to be further investigated and might be discussed on an in­ dividual basis for nodular BCC. 8.3.2. 5-Fluorouracil The 5% formulation of the antimetabolite 5-FU is li­ cenced for the treatment of sBCC with two applications daily for 3–6 weeks. A few studies evaluated the efficacy of 5% 5-FU in sBCC with no long-term follow-up data [139,140]. As described above, a recent RCT comparing 5% 5-FU with imiquimod 5% and MAL-PDT in sBCC demonstrated that topical 5-FU is inferior to imiquimod and non-inferior to MAL-PDT in the treatment of sBCC after 3 [132] and 5 years of follow-up [133]. Rates of local side-effects are similar to those seen with imi­ quimod, but flu-like symptoms were not observed [131]. 8.4. Photodynamic therapy PDT combines the use of a topical photosensitizer (5-ami­ nolaevulinic acid [ALA] or MAL) and illumination with visible light, leading to the production of reactive oxygen species, resulting in apoptosis and selective tumour cell necrosis. MAL cream and ALA nanoemulsion formulation are currently approved in Europe for the treatment of low- risk superficial and nodular BCCs. Treatment consists of two sessions 1 week apart [141,142]. PDT with 5-ALA or MAL should be considered in patients with non-aggressive, low-risk BCC, that is, small superficial and nodular types not exceeding 2 mm tumour thickness, where surgery is not suitable or contraindicated due to patient-related limitations (age and comorbidities, medications, logistic difficulties) [124].

mm tumour thickness, where surgery is not suitable or contraindicated due to patient-related limitations (age and comorbidities, medications, logistic difficulties) [124]. Less common histo­ pathological variants, as morpheic, pigmented and micro­ nodular BCCs, as well as BCCs in areas with high risk of tumour recurrence and deep penetration (facial ‘H’-zone) should not be treated with PDT. MAL-PDT achieved clearance rates of 92−97% for sBCC at 3 months, with recurrence rates of 9% at 1 year and 22% at 5 years [119,125]. In a real-life prospective head-to-head compar­ ison study, the cumulative probability of tumour-free sur­ vival at 5 years after treatment of sBCCs was 62.7% for MAL-PDT compared to 80.5% for imiquimod 5% cream and 70.8% for 5-FU. [133]. For nodular BCC treated by MAL-PDT, 91% were clinically clear at 3 months, with a sustained lesion clearance response rate of 76% after 5 years of follow-up [126]. MAL-PDT was equivalent to surgery (92% versus 99% initial clearance, 9% and 0% recurrences at 1 year, respectively) for sBCC but inferior to excision for nodular BCC when recurrence rates are compared (14% and 4% recurrences at 5 years, respectively) [125,126]. Clearance rates were equivalent when MAL-PDT was compared with cryotherapy for the treatment of sBCC with no difference in the 5-year recurrence rates with either treatment (20% with cryotherapy versus 22% with MAL-PDT, p = 0.86) [119]. The cosmetic outcome, however, was superior following PDT compared with either surgery or cryotherapy [119,126]. PDT using the ALA nanoemulsion gel was compared with MAL in the treatment of non-aggressive BCC (superficial and nod­ ular < 2 cm). At 12 months after the last PDT treatment, 93.4% of the ALA-treated patients were complete re­ sponders compared with 91.8% in the MAL group, es­ tablishing non-inferiority (p < 0.0001) [143].

control rate at 12 months of 56.3% of the lesions [144]. Excellent cosmetic results with high patient satisfaction have been reported after PDT [141], although pain/dis­ comfort during illumination is the prominent adverse effect of conventional PDT [124]. Discontinuous illu­ mination (fractionation) was proposed to increase the efficacy of PDT by permitting tissue reoxygenation during ‘dark’ periods. Fractionated ALA-PDT pro­ duced a superior response in sBCC versus single PDT (88% versus 75%, respectively) but significantly lower than conventional two-stage MAL-PDT (70.7% versus 76.5%, respectively), 5 years after treatment [145,146]. In nodular BCC, the 5-year cumulative probability of recurrence after surgical excision (2.3%) was lower than after fractionated ALA-PDT with prior debulking (30.7%) [147]. New photosensitising agents and delivery systems for PDT in BCC are currently under in­ vestigation. 8.5. Combined therapies Combining treatment modalities relies on the com­ plementary or synergistic mechanisms of action of each of them and should be reserved for clinical si­ tuations that are not suitable for standard treatment, such as surgery. Partial destruction of nodular or pigmented BCC prior to MAL-PDT can increase the cure rate. In nodular BCC, pretreatment with CO2, Er:YAG, diode lasers, or surgical debulking increases the cure rates up to 92.9−98.9% [148]. UltraPulse CO2 laser prior to the standard two MAL-PDT sessions had a complete clinical clearance of 100% and a recurrence-free rate of 97.1% after a mean follow-up period of 32.2 months [149]. CO2 laser followed by two/three cycles of MAL-PDT provided better responses in BCC thinner than 2 mm with a 93.6% 5-year recurrence-free rate and a direct cost saving of 43% [150]. One single session of Er:YAG AFL-primed MAL-PDT determined a complete response rate of 84.2% at 3 months compared with 50% after two MAL-PDT sessions and a 1-year recurrence rate of 6.3% and 55.6%, respectively [122]. Contact cryotherapy applied after CO2 laser ablation and MAL-PDT in a small case series of BCCs resulted in complete response and no recurrences after 22 months of follow-up [151]. The use of AFL to increase the delivery of cisplatin and 5-FU in low- risk superficial and nodular BCCs showed overall complete tumour clearance in 89% (17/19) and 79% (15/19) of cases at 6 and 12 months, respectively [152]. Curettage debulking with complete removal of mac­ roscopic pigment followed by MAL-PDT showed a complete response in 76.2% and a 1-year recurrence rate of 19.1% in pigmented BCC [153]. The reduction of the tumour burden of nodular BCC with curettage prior to imiquimod showed a clearance rate of 96% at an average of 36 months follow-up [154]. In one RCT, the 1-year free of recurrence rate was 86.3% for nodular BCC patients treated with curettage and imiquimod and 100% for those treated with surgery [155]. The combination of PDT with imiquimod has been reported in small case series or case reports [156]. The cure rate for recurrent BCCs increased from 60% to 75% when imiquimod was administered after two sessions of PDT compared to PDT alone [157]. Cryotherapy in imiquimod-refractory BCCs resulted in 83% of clinical response rate [158]. In addition, cryotherapy applied between the second and fifth weeks of imiquimod treatment (immunocryosurgery) achieved an efficacy of 95% in primary nodular BCCs with a 5-year tumour- free rate of 91.4% [159]. Neoadjuvant treatment with imiquimod prior to Mohs surgery showed a significant reduction of the tumour size and resulted in a smaller surgical defect compared to vehicle [160]. However, it can produce discontinuous tumour nests, reducing the accuracy of margin evaluation during Mohs surgery [161]. Adjuvant ALA-PDT after Mohs surgery in facial superficial and nodular BCCs showed recurrences in 1 of 84 lesions after 2 years [162]. The level of evidence of combined treatment is low because most combinations are supported by small series and/or

nodular BCCs showed recurrences in 1 of 84 lesions after 2 years [162]. The level of evidence of combined treatment is low because most combinations are supported by small series and/or short follow-up time and are applied in off- label situations. 8.6. Radiotherapy Radiotherapy is a valid alternative to surgery and may be considered as a primary treatment in patients who are not candidates for surgery (e.g. locally advanced disease, comorbidities, or those who decline surgery) or in cases when curative surgery is not possible or could be disfiguring or burdened by poor aesthetic outcome [163,164], including BCCs located on the face (i.e. eyelid, nose, lip) or large lesions on the ear, fore­ head, or scalp [165,166]. A systematic review and net­ work meta-analysis on primary BCC analysing 40 randomised trials and five non-randomised studies with variable follow-up, reported an estimated recurrence rate of 3.5% after radiotherapy, that is fully comparable to standard surgery (3.8%) and Mohs surgery (3.8%) [163]. The risk of developing a radiotherapy-induced secondary skin cancer is negligible using appropriate radiation doses but needs to be considered in younger patients together with discussion on long-term cosmesis. Different radiotherapy techniques have been de­ veloped to date: external beam radiotherapy (surface/ orthovoltage X-rays, electron, and megavoltage photon treatment) remains the most used treatment modality. However, interstitial interventional radio­ therapy (or interstitial brachytherapy) and contact radiotherapy (surface brachytherapy and electronic brachytherapy) represent alternative treatment stra­ tegies. The choice between external beam radio­ therapy and brachytherapy must consider many factors: lesion size, location and infiltration depth, K.

team expertise, and institutional resources [164]. Re­ sults of brachytherapy are comparable to those ob­ tained with external beam radiotherapy with the advantage of the rapid dose falloff allowing to spare the surrounding tissue [164,167,168]. Furthermore, the use of intensity-modulated brachytherapy (step­ ping source technique) allows optimisation and in­ dividualisation of the dose distribution, especially when the implant configuration is difficult due to anatomical reasons [168]. Various prescription sche­ dules are used in external beam radiotherapy and brachytherapy. The total prescribed dose and frac­ tionation should reflect the differences in radio­ biological effectiveness between different radiation modalities. Advanced lesions may be treated with megavoltage radiation to doses between 60 and 70 Gy, using 2 Gy fractions, five fractions per week; hypo­ fractionated approaches such as 45 Gy in 10 fractions or 54 Gy in 18 fractions represent equi-effective treatment schedules. Hypofractionated radiotherapy results in good cosmetic outcomes [169], although the dose per fraction should also be defined on the basis of the tumour site and possible functional and aes­ thetic results. Indeed, protracted fractionation seems to be associated with improved cosmetic results and should be utilised for poorly vascularised or cartila­ ginous areas (NCCN, version 1.2023; https://www. nccn.org). The prescribed dose must encompass all visible tumour plus an appropriate variable margin (clinical target volume), sparing as much as possible the surrounding healthy structures [164]. Irrespective of treatment intent (definitive, adjuvant, palliative), dosimetric and technical considerations should be surveyed by a certified medical physicist. Radiotherapy is an overall safe procedure, although it can be associated with complications such as a tran­ sient acute, rarely erosive, radiation-induced dermatitis and chronic onset of depigmentation and telangiecta­ sias. We suggest avoiding radiotherapy in young pa­ tients as the potential risk of long-term trophic disorders is not well addressed; however, if needed, the decision should be shared in the context of the multidisciplinary tumour board. Radiotherapy may be also considered after in­ complete resection with microscopic (R1) or macro­ scopic (R2) residual tumour, when the tumour board does not consider follow-up or a wide surgical excision as the best option. 8.7. Electrochemotherapy ECT is a treatment option that may be offered when surgery or radiotherapy are not feasible or contra­ indicated [138]. ECT provides its antitumor effect through the permeabilisation of cancer cells to che­ motherapeutic agents (bleomycin or cisplatin) by means of short, high-voltage, electric pulses which destabilise the cell membrane barrier allowing their intracellular access. The main advantages of ECT are high local tu­ mour control with minimal damage to normal tissue, limited side-effects, and good cost/benefit ratio. Over the past 20 years, ECT has been applied mainly in a pal­ liative setting allowing the control of bleeding and mass- related symptoms. Data from the International Net­ work for Sharing Practice in ECT (InspECT), a pan- European collaboration of centres encompassing dif­ ferent specialties that treat cutaneous malignancies, support that ECT is a consistent and reliable treatment option in specific settings of patients. The reported overall response and complete response rates for BCC with ECT were 96% and 85%, respectively [170]. A registry-based study of InspECT reported 623 BCCs of 330 patients treated with bleomycin-ECT with complete response after a single ECT course in 81% of patients. Toxicity included skin ulceration (overall, 16%; G3, 1%) and hyperpigmentation (overall, 8.1%; G3, 2.5%). At a 17-month follow-up, 9.3% of patients experienced local recurrence/progression [171]. A prospective RCT in­ vestigating ECT versus surgery in patients with BCC reported no evidence of

2.5%). At a 17-month follow-up, 9.3% of patients experienced local recurrence/progression [171]. A prospective RCT in­ vestigating ECT versus surgery in patients with BCC reported no evidence of recurrence at 5 years in 97.5% of BCC lesions treated with surgery and in 87.5% of those treated with ECT [172]. ECT can be used in the treatment of locally advanced or recurrent BCC when standard treatments are not feasible, with good tumour control and functional results without systemic adverse events. 9. Management of advanced BCC 9.1. Surgical therapy of laBCC Front-line surgical therapy of laBCC is hampered by the difficulty of achieving the complete removal of the tumour (R0 resection) and by potential major surgical morbidity that may result from complete resection. However, sur­ gery is expected to play a role in the palliative setting (i.e. unmanageable bleeding tumours, unbearable pain, etc.), and as part of the neoadjuvant approach once sys­ temic therapy succeeds in reducing tumour burden, al­ lowing a downstaging of the surgical procedure in functionally sensitive locations [173,174]. The appropriate management of patients with laBCC should be planned in the context of the skin cancer multidisciplinary tumour board after complete physical examination and imaging studies (Computed tomography-scan, MRI) aimed at identifying invasion of deep structures (bone, muscles, vessels) and perineural invasion. 9.2. Radiotherapy of laBCC In the management of laBCC, radiation therapy is considered in the palliative setting to improve patient’s quality of life, especially for alleviating cancer- K.

associated symptoms/signs such as pain, bleeding, and ulceration [175]. In this setting, short-course ac­ celerated-hypofractionated radiotherapy can be per­ formed by delivering the total dose with few fractions, increasing the dose per fraction, resulting in better pa­ tient’s compliance [176]. However, radiotherapy (ex­ ternal beam or interventional) can also be proposed with a curative intent for laBCC due to recent techno­ logical innovations, especially intensity-modulated and image-guided radiotherapy, which provide high-preci­ sion treatments with excellent local control and a low rate of side-effects [177,178]. Preliminary evidence seems to encourage the combination of radiotherapy with systemic therapies, either HHI or immunotherapy, in a neoadjuvant setting or as a concomitant approach [179,180] based on the potential synergistic effect, and the fact that the dose of radiotherapy may be modulated according to the clinical response. 9.3. Hedgehog inhibitors Vismodegib and sonidegib are specific inhibitors of an oncogenic protein named Smoothened and are both approved by FDA and EMA for the treatment of pa­ tients with laBCC who are not candidates for surgery or radiotherapy; vismodegib is also approved for mBCC whereas sonidegib is approved for mBCC only in Switzerland and Australia. The oral dose is 150 mg/day for vismodegib and 200 mg/day for sonidegib. A phase 2 pivotal clinical trial (ERIVANCE) in pa­ tients with laBCC and mBCC treated with vismodegib showed an overall response rate of 43% or 60% for laBCC and 30% or 45% for mBCC by independent re­ view or site investigator, respectively. The median duration of response was 7.6 months, and the median progression-free survival was 9.5 months in both co­ horts [181]. The long-term update of ERIVANCE after 39 months of follow-up showed an investigator-assessed overall response rate of 60.3% in the laBCC group (20 patients with complete response and 18 patients with partial response) and of 48.5% in the mBCC group (all partial responses). The median duration of response was 26.2 months for laBCC) and 14.8 months for mBCC. Median overall survival was not estimable in the laBCC cohort and was 33.4 months in the mBCC cohort [182]. The results of the ERIVANCE trial have been con­ firmed by a global safety study (STEVIE) that revealed a response rate (investigator-assessed) of 68.5% for laBCC and 36.9% for mBCC after a median follow-up of 17.9 months [183]. In the sonidegib pivotal clinical trial (BOLT), the objective response was 43% (central review) or 67% (investigator review) for laBCC and 15% (central review) or 23% (investigator review) for mBCC for the 200 mg daily dose after a median follow-up of 13.9 months, using very stringent modified RECIST criteria. The duration of tumour response was 20.2 months and progression-free survival was 22.0 months (investigator review) [184]. The final 42-month analysis of BOLT reported an objective response rate of 56% for laBCC and of 8% for mBCC per central review. The median duration of response was 26.1 months in laBCC and 24.0 months in mBCC. The median progression- free survival was 22.1 months (not estimable) for laBCC and 13.1 months for mBCC [185]. Multiple BCCs in patients with Gorlin syndrome should be considered as laBCCs and treated accordingly. They have been in­ cluded as small subgroups in the pivotal clinical trials of vismodegib (ERIVANCE) and sonidegib (BOLT). In a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-con­ trolled, phase 2 trial, a significant reduced rate of new surgically eligible BCCs and a reduction in size of the existing BCCs were observed in Gorlin patients treated with vismodegib compared with patients in the placebo group [186]. Reinduction with HHI in 12 patients with advanced BCC who failed a first-line HHI and second-line anti- PD1 inhibitor was recently reported with a 33% com­ plete/partial response, 50% stable disease, and 17% progression [187].

failed a first-line HHI and second-line anti- PD1 inhibitor was recently reported with a 33% com­ plete/partial response, 50% stable disease, and 17% progression [187]. In laBCCs, a neoadjuvant treatment with a HHI with the intention to shrink lesions can be discussed, al­ though there are no randomised data to prove its ben­ eficial outcome. In the VISMONEO study, 55 patients with BCC considered inoperable or operable with functional or major aesthetic impact were treated with oral vismodegib 150 mg/d for 4–10 months. In 44 (80%) patients, a downstaging of the surgical procedure was possible after HHI neoadjuvant treatment [173]. Radiotherapy could be used in combination with HHI [180] and may be indicated after surgery when perineural invasion is present [177]. During treatment with HHI, class-specific adverse events such as muscle spasms, taste alterations, hair loss, fatigue, and weight loss appear in most patients and lead to treatment discontinuation in approximately 30% of patients [188]. No treatment-related deaths have been reported in clinical trials with HHI. Different preventive and management strategies related to address the side- effects have been proposed to improve patients’ quality of life and clinical benefit [189]. Drug holidays or dose reduction have been considered alternatives in the management of drug toxicities from HHIs [190]. 9.4. Immunotherapy The rationale of using anti-PD1 immunotherapy in pa­ tients with advanced BCC stemmed from several lines of experimental and clinical evidence: i) BCC has one of the highest TMB of any human malignancy and is in the same range as for cutaneous SCC; ii) BCC represents a UV-induced tumour with immunogenic features; iii) the risk of BCC is 10 times higher in organ transplant re­ cipients and other groups with induced or acquired lack of immunosurveillance than in the general population, K.

suggesting that adaptive immune responses are specifi­ cally important in this disease [191,192]. Therefore, pa­ tients with laBCC and mBCC can be considered as good candidates for a response to immune checkpoint in­ hibitors like PD-1 antibodies. In 2021, a pivotal clinical trial investigating intravenous cemiplimab (REGN- ONC 1620), a recombinant IgG4 human monoclonal anti-PD-1 antibody, in patients with advanced BCC was published [193]. This single-arm, phase 2, multicenter clinical trial included patients who had progressed or were intolerant to previous HHI therapies. Eighty-four laBCC patients received cemiplimab with the conven­ tional dose of 350 mg intravenously every 3 weeks for up to 93 weeks or until progression or unacceptable toxi­ city. In an independent central review, the primary end- point (overall response rate) of the clinical trial was met. The objective response rate was 31%. Five patients (6%) had a complete response. Apart from the conventional adverse events known for all anti-PD-1 antibodies in other cancer entities, there were no specific new adverse events observed. In addition, there were no treatment- related deaths. The cohort of patients with laBCC was updated at the EADO conference 2022 (21st–23rd April 2022, Sevilla, Spain; Stratigos et al.) with a longer follow-up time (15.9 months). A complete response was observed in 7.1% of patients and partial response in 25.0%, with an observed duration of response of 85.2% at 6 months. The disease control rate was 79.8%. The median progression-free survival was 16.5 months while the median for overall survival had not been reached. At 2 years, 80.3% of the patients are still alive. There were no new safety signals. A primary analysis on 54 patients with mBCC from REGN-ONC 1620 was recently pre­ sented and currently submitted. One complete response (1.9%) and 12 partial responses (22.2%) with a median duration of response of 16.7 months were shown. The median progression-free survival was 8.3 months, while the median overall survival had not been reached. At 12 months, 84.4% of patients were still alive. There were no new safety signals reported, and the tolerability of ce­ miplimab in the mBCC cohort was similar to that of the laBCC cohort. In summary, cemiplimab provided a clinically meaningful antitumoral activity in mBCC and laBCC patients, who had progressed or were intolerant to conventional first-line HHIs. The safety profile was generally consistent with previous reports on cemi­ plimab and other PD-1 inhibitors. Cemiplimab has been approved by FDA and EMA in 2021 and re­ presents the only approved PD-1 antibody for advanced BCC patients. 9.5. Chemotherapy The use of systemic chemotherapy for mBCC has been addressed only in case reports and case series. Most patients with widespread metastases received platinum- based chemotherapies. The response rate was not higher than 20−30%, but occasionally response rates up to 60% have been reported. However, in almost all successfully treated cases, the response duration was no longer than 2–3 months [194]. Chemotherapy might be considered for laBCC and mBCC in patients who are not re­ sponsive or have progressed after HHI and PD-1 in­ hibitors, alone or in combination with radiotherapy. 9.6. Best supportive care In advanced BCC, most frequently occurring in elderly patients, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is an important consideration when determining the best treatment plan and should be evaluated continuously during treatment. Several tools such as the EORTC QLQ-C30 are widely used for this purpose [195]. Con­ sideration should be given to nutritional, psychological, social, and existential needs to improve overall quality of life in the palliative setting consulting a palliative care specialist/team (WHO Definition of Palliative Care; https://www.who.int/cancer/palliative/definition/en/).

life in the palliative setting consulting a palliative care specialist/team (WHO Definition of Palliative Care; https://www.who.int/cancer/palliative/definition/en/). Advanced care planning, conversations about wishes, needs, and values of individual patients should be started. Advanced BCC may cause signs/symptoms related to the depth of infiltration and local cancer involvement as pain, ulceration, exudate, and odour, which have a great impact on HRQoL and patients’ well-being. Pain should be assessed regularly using validated pain scales [195]. The visual analogue scale, the verbal rating scale, and the numerical rating scale (NRS) are the most frequently used. When the score exceeds 2 of 10, a conversation about pain is required. Analgesics for chronic pain are best taken orally and should be prescribed on a regular basis instead of an ‘as required’ schedule [196]. The WHO proposes a sequential three-step analgesic ladder strategy, from non-opioids (paracetamol, non-ster­ oidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) to weak opioids to strong opioids according to pain scores [197]. However, if a patient already suffers from intermediate (NRS 4) to severe (NRS 7) pain, weak opioids (e.g. tramadol, dihydrocodeine, and codeine) might be best added immediately to the mild analgesics. In ul­ cerated or exudating tumours, surgery, radiotherapy, or ECT should be discussed to achieve local control or alleviate symptoms [171,198]. Radiotherapy is particu­ larly helpful to relieve pain, to stop haemorrhage, and to limit tumour extension to adjacent critical areas such as the orbits [175]. A daily rinsing with tap water or so­ dium chloride cleaning fluid is mandatory to control odour. In a large review, evidence was found for topical metronidazole (gel or solution in concentrations of 0.75−0.8%, once daily for at least 14 days), sodium chloride dressing, activated carbon dressing, and cur­ cumin ointment [199]. Topical metronidazole is effective against anaerobic bacteria and protozoa, but it can also be orally administrated (500 mg three times daily, for K.

10–14 days). Absorbent dressing made up of viscose or polyester impregnated with sodium chloride acts through the hypertonic effect produced on the lesion [199]. In a randomised study, 0.2% polyhexamethylene biguanide achieved no malignant wound odour by day 8 in all patients and proved to be equally effective as metronidazole 0.8% solution [200,201]. Furthermore, odour control significantly improved the general HRQoL. Applying zinc oxide paste or silicone gel on the surrounding skin can prevent maceration due to tumour exudate. Application of calcium alginate dressings, dressings with xylometazoline or adrenaline (1:1000) or silver nitrate can temporarily stop bleeding [201]. Management strategies of bleeding depend on severity and are based on local modalities, such as haemostatic agents and dressings, radiotherapy, endoscopic ligation and coagulation in case of gastrointestinal bleeding, and transcutaneous arterial embolisation [202]. 10. Clinical trials A number of second-generation agents inhibiting the Hh signalling pathway are currently being studied such as patidegib, saridegib (IPI-926), taladegib (LY2940680), and silmitasertib (CX4945). Topical patidegib 2% and 4% have been reported to reduce facial BCCs in patients with Gorlin syndrome, and the 2% gel has been further studied in a phase 3 clinical trial which has now been completed (NCT03703310). Silmitasertib (CX-4945), an ATP-competitive, small molecule inhibitor of casein- kinase II (NCT03897036), is being investigated in laBCC and mBCC resistant to SMO inhibition. Intralesional treatments are a strong focus of ongoing clinical trials with the advantage of reduced dosage, increased activity due to a higher local concentration and possibly a reduction of immune-related adverse events in comparison to intravenous administration. One study is investigating the role of intralesional ce­ miplimab in BCC and cutaneous SCC (NCT03889912). Several trials are evaluating the effect of oncolytic viruses like TVEC (NCT03458117) or RP-1 (tested for cutaneous malignancies in organ transplant recipients, NCT04349436). Intralesional application of L19IL2/ L19TNF (Daromun/Fibromun)—IL-2 or TNF linked to a human single-chain variable fragment directed against the extra-domain B of fibronectin—is tested in two trials that also include patients with advanced BCC (NCT04362722, NCT05329792). Other intralesional treatments include IFx-Hu2.0, a pDNA-encoding Emm55 autologous cancer cell vaccine (NCT04925713), and STP705, a siRNA in an advanced nanoparticle delivery system that targets TGF-β1 and COX-2, cur­ rently being evaluated in a phase II, dose escalation study (NCT04669808). ASN002, an intralesional re­ combinant adenovirus vector, delivering the human in­ terferon (IFN)-gene into BCC cells leading to a sustained local IFNγ concentration, is investigated in a phase II trial in patients with multiple sporadic BCCs or Gorlin syndrome in combination with vismodegib (NCT04416516). Similar to melanoma and cutaneous SCC, there is also strong interest in the neoadjuvant treatment of advanced BCC. A phase 2 trial investigating neoadju­ vant sonidegib followed by surgery or imiquimod is currently recruiting patients (NCT03534947). Early clinical data on 18 patients from an ongoing neoadju­ vant trial of TVEC in BCC (neo-BCC) showed a re­ duction in tumour size with improved operability in most patients (Ressler et al., poster presented at ESMO 2022). Pembrolizumab is assessed as a perioperative, neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy, in patients with re­ sectable advanced BCC of the head and neck (NCT04323202). Combination systemic therapies are being investigated in patients with unresectable, ad­ vanced BCC. A phase 2 trial compares anti-PD1 nivo­ lumab in combination with anti-CTLA4 (ipilimumab) or anti-LAG3 (relatlimab) in patients who progressed on single-agent nivolumab (NCT03521830).

Follow-up Follow-up should be performed in patients with BCC because of the risk of local recurrence, subsequent BCC development as well as increased risk of the develop­ ment of other skin cancers (SCC and melanoma) [1,203]. There is no evidence that intensive follow-up results in better outcomes (burden of disease, cosmetic results) in patients with low-risk BCC [204,205]. However, a recent study showed that BCC patients need to receive all the relevant information tailored to their situation, and therefore it seems reasonable to provide one follow-up visit for all BCC patients to discuss their diagnosis and treatment, to counsel them about sun-protection mea­ sures, and to stress the importance of self-monitoring for possible local recurrence and new skin cancers [206]. The risk of tumour recurrence depends on the histo­ pathological subtype, size, and location of the primary tumour and the treatment used. For most primary BCCs treated according to guidelines, this risk is low. However, recurrence rates are higher for recurrent BCC or BCC at high-risk sites on the face with further in­ crease for multiple lesions [207,208]. Patients with re­ current lesions should therefore be counselled accordingly and should be advised to come back for clinical evaluations if they notice any changes at the site of previous surgery. Most metachronous BCCs occur within the first 3 years after diagnosis, but the risk re­ mains elevated over time [209,210]. A meta-analysis K.

observed a pooled mean 5-year cumulative risk of a subsequent BCC of 36%, comparable to another ob­ servational study [204,210]. When primary BCCs are found in large numbers and the age of onset is below 30 years, the patient should be screened for potential Gorlin syndrome. These patients are also at increased risk of other tumours, and their care needs to be dis­ cussed at multidisciplinary meetings with a team having experience in looking after these high-risk patients in whom surgical modalities may not be optimal or fea­ sible. A recent systematic review highlighted the lack of consistent follow-up recommendations among available guidelines for BCC [203]. Overall, there seem to be two groups of patients that would require a more rigorous and long-term follow-up: (1) patients who are at high risk for recurrent lesions, such as those who have al­ ready been treated for recurrent BCC, and (2) patients with a history of multiple BCCs. These patients should benefit from a follow-up every 12 months for 3–5 years (if not lifelong). In cases of difficult-to-treat or advanced BCC, follow-up should be discussed by a multi­ disciplinary team at a frequency dictated by each in­ dividual case. 12. Diagnosis and management of patients with Gorlin syndrome Gorlin syndrome is a rare, autosomal dominant familial cancer syndrome with a high degree of penetrance and variable expression. Its prevalence is estimated at one per 40,000–60,000 persons. Gorlin syndrome is caused by mutations in the PTCH1 gene, with de novo mutations occurring in 20−30% of patients, and more rarely by mutations in SMO, SUFU, and PTCH2 genes [211]. The diagnosis of Gorlin syndrome is established in a proband with the following findings: two major diagnostic criteria and one minor diagnostic criterion or one major and three minor diagnostic criteria [212]. Major criteria: multiple BCCs (> 5 in a lifetime) or a BCC before 30 years of age, lamellar (sheet-like) calcification of the falx, jaw keratocyst before 20 years of age, medulloblastoma (des­ moplastic variant), palmar/plantar pits, first-degree relative with Gorlin syndrome. Minor criteria: lymphomesenteric or pleural cysts, macrocephaly (occipitofrontal circumference > 97th centile), cleft lip/palate, vertebral/rib anomalies ob­ served on chest X-ray and/or spinal X-ray, preaxial or postaxial polydactyly, ovarian/cardiac fibromas, ocular anomalies. Genetic testing should be performed in selected pa­ tients with suspected Gorlin syndrome: (1) prenatal testing if known familial mutation; (2) confirmatory diagnosis in patients with some clinical signs but not meeting criteria as this would allow for increased sur­ veillance and improved patient care outcomes; (3) pre­ dictive testing for patients with an affected family member who is at risk but does not meet clinical criteria [211]. Approaches to molecular testing may include se­ rial testing of a single gene (PTCH1, SUFU), the use of a multigene panel, and more comprehensive genomic testing [213]. Radiological abnormalities such as dys­ morphisms or other skeletal anomalies may be seen in up to 60% of patients with Gorlin syndrome, but in­ vestigations for diagnostic criteria should be avoided if they remain without therapeutic consequences to keep X-ray exposure as low as possible [214]. Close surveillance and regular skin examinations carried out by a dermatologist trained in skin cancer detection and dermatoscopy are required to diagnose and treat BCCs at an early stage. Total body skin ex­ amination, including scalp and genitalia, should be carried out annually starting at the age of 10 years in carries of PTCH1 variants and at the age of 20 years in SUFU variant carriers, and then every 4–6 months [215]. Depending on the number, size, location, and subtype of BCCs, treatment approaches used for sporadic BCC, besides radiotherapy, can be considered. The benefit of surgery should be weighed against the high risk of re­ current or newly developing BCCs and

BCCs, treatment approaches used for sporadic BCC, besides radiotherapy, can be considered. The benefit of surgery should be weighed against the high risk of re­ current or newly developing BCCs and should be limited to solitary high-risk BCCs. Vice versa, small or super­ ficial variants in low-risk areas outside the face may be managed by topical treatments and/or by careful watchful waiting during follow-up. Radiotherapy must be avoided because of the carcinogenic effect of X-rays resulting in the formation of new BCCs. The manage­ ment of locally advanced tumours should be discussed in the context of a multidisciplinary tumour board [213]. There is emerging evidence about some specific geno­ type–phenotype correlations in patients with Gorlin syndrome, which has led to the introduction of specific follow-up recommendations. Patients with SUFU pa­ thogenic variants are significantly more likely than those with PTCH1 pathogenic variants to develop medullo­ blastoma, meningioma, or ovarian fibroma [216]. In addition, Gorlin patients with skeletal abnormalities have been reported to be at greater risk for developing more numerous and severe BCCs as well as other neo­ plastic growths including keratocystic odontogenic tu­ mours and ovarian fibromas [217]. According to these findings, more vigilant lifetime multidisciplinary sur­ veillance should be considered for these patients starting in childhood. Besides regular skin examinations, additional imaging investigations are recommended for associated extra­ cutaneous abnormalities. In particular, childhood brain MRI surveillance for the risk of medulloblastoma is jus­ tified in SUFU-related, but not in PTCH1-related, Gorlin syndrome. Finally, the Host Genome Working Group suggests annual follow-up by a medical geneticist or pae­ diatric/adult physician familiar with the syndrome to check for non-tumoral manifestation of the syndromes, educate on red flag symptoms, and ensure that all screening procedures are performed [215].

Rousseau et al. [215] and Verkouteren et al. [214] is listed in Table 4. 13. Primary prevention 13.1. Sun protection and preventive measures The mainstay of primary prevention consists of avoiding excessive exposure to UV, both natural from the sun and from artificial sources, due to the proven role of UV radiation in the development of BCC. A strong association between BCC development and the number of sunburns is documented [218]. Also, tanning bed users have an increased risk of BCC compared to non-tanning bed users, and the risk is even higher for individuals who use a tanning bed for the first time at the age of less than 20 years [31,219]. Exposure to ex­ cessive solar radiation can be reduced by seeking shade, wearing appropriate, covering clothes, and using sunscreens. The use of tanning beds should be avoided. UV-protection measures should be observed in parti­ cular by individuals at high-risk, as children and ado­ lescents, subjects with sun-sensitive phototypes, with personal or family history of skin cancer, with im­ munosuppression and in individuals who spend ex­ tended time outdoors for professional or recreational activities. Patients diagnosed with BCC have an in­ creased risk of developing further skin cancers [220,221]. Therefore, it is recommended that all BCC patients should be educated about the avoidance of excessive exposure to UV radiation, both solar and from sunbeds, and about regular skin surveillance. 13.2. Chemoprevention Regarding oral supplements, some studies have sug­ gested that Mediterranean diet [222] and high caffeine intake [223] decrease the risk of BCC, although no conclusive evidence exists supporting a particular dietary pattern as preventive measure for BCC. Oral supplementation of antioxidants (selenium, vitamin A, beta-carotene) has not reduced the incidence of BCC in a meta-analysis of RCT and cannot be recommended [224]. Vitamin D should be supplemented if deficient, especially in individuals practicing consistent, compre­ hensive photoprotection. No further benefit of vitamin D supplementation has been proven yet for the pre­ vention of BCC. Nicotinamide is a water-soluble form of vitamin B3 (niacin) that is considered to play a role in enhancing the repair of photodamaged DNA and pre­ vent the immune-inhibitory effects of UV radiation [225]. In a phase III RCT, oral nicotinamide 500 mg twice daily for 12 months was associated with a 20% reduction of the development rate of BCC in im­ munocompetent patients with previous multiple skin cancer history [226]. The effect appeared limited to the duration of treatment. Therefore, nicotinamide is a safe Table 4 Recommended screening for patients with Gorlin syndrome.

and inexpensive solution that could be taken into con­ sideration to enhance the prevention of BCC in this category of high-risk patients. Evidence is not sufficient to recommend nicotinamide for the primary prevention of BCC in the general population. In a recent 12 month, placebo-controlled trial, supplementation with oral ni­ cotinamide did not lead to lower numbers of BCCs in immunosuppressed solid-organ transplant recipients [227]. While oral retinoids are used for the chemopre­ vention of SCC in high-risk patients, current evidence shows a low efficacy and does not support their use for the prevention of BCC, especially considering the ben­ efits versus side-effects risk balance. A meta-analysis of 11 studies estimated a 10% risk reduction of BCC among patients using any NSAIDs (relative risk [RR], 0.90 [95% CI, 0.84–0.97]). A smaller, not statistically significant inverse association was observed for non- aspirin NSAIDs (RR, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.86–1.02]) [228]. These effects were strongest in the high-risk population with actinic keratoses or skin cancer history. The effect size was low, the studies heterogeneous, and more re­ search is warranted on the dosing, timing, type, and potential confounders of the preventive effect of NSAIDs before a recommendation can be made re­ garding their use for the chemoprevention of BCC, especially taking into consideration their potential car­ diovascular adverse effects on long-term use. There is currently no evidence supporting the efficacy of topical treatments, including tazarotene and tretinoin, for the primary prevention of BCC [229,230]. 14. Communication with patients When diagnosing BCC, it is important to explain to patients that these tumours are only locally invasive and will not have any detrimental effects on survival unless in rare high-risk or advanced cases. Even though most tumours are growing slowly, the potential consequences of foregoing treatment should be explained. There may be a need to discuss surgery-associated morbidity as the psychological impact of disfiguring surgery cannot be underestimated. The patient should always be offered choices when treating BCC, where appropriate. This is especially relevant when different referral pathways lead patients to either surgical or dermatological services because the availability of different treatment modalities may differ between specialties. In elderly patients, the choice of curettage and cautery for BCC (when appro­ priate for low-risk BCCs) needs to be discussed, as this can also avoid more invasive surgical treatments with grafts and flaps. Patients who have had radiotherapy in the past are also at an increased risk of BCC on the irradiated site, mainly of low-risk and infundibolocystic subtype [231,232], and these patients cannot be treated with radiotherapy again for the risk of major compli­ cations. Therefore, it is important to check for previous radiotherapy in the field in the past medical history. Immunosuppressed patients with BCC should be fol­ lowed up in dedicated clinics as these patients are at high risk of SCC as well. There are a lot of debates and controversial studies on the risks and benefits of in­ creasing vitamin D intake in BCC patients. In a recent meta-analysis, it was ascertained that the literature supports keeping vitamin D serum levels below 30–60 nmol/L, considering it to be a balanced level [233]. Pa­ tients with BCC should be informed that they should remain vigilant and keep an eye for potential re­ currences as well as new primaries. The risk of devel­ oping a second BCC is 10 times the risk of the general population [220]. If patients present with multiple Box 23 Diagnosis—Gorlin syndrome.

primaries at the onset, they should be warned that their risk of relapse is higher. Truncal BCCs, especially of the superficial types, often have multiple new primaries in the first 5 years after the original diagnosis [234]. There are patients who may need long-term follow-up, as discussed before, and these are likely to be those with high-risk tumours, high-risk sites, multiple BCCs, and Gorlin syndrome. Patients with Gorlin syndrome should be reassured as these patients often become highly anxious about having multiple skin cancers. Al­ though they present with a large number of tumours from a young age, the BCCs usually are not as ag­ gressive as sporadic BCCs. When proposing systemic treatment with HHI in Gorlin syndrome, patients should be made aware of the side-effects and the clin­ ician should carefully weigh the advantages and dis­ advantages of such treatments on a case-by-case basis. Most Gorlin patients treated with HHI do not stay on the drug for more than 6 months as significant side-ef­ fects are common (especially muscle cramps), and these may be severe [188]. These agents are therefore unlikely to be the answer for long-term management, and in­ termittent dosing should be openly discussed with pa­ tients. The use of non-surgical options is especially important in Gorlin patients and needs to be considered as much as possible and discussed at every visit with the patient. In suspected Gorlin syndrome, there is also a need to discuss potential genetic testing. Gorlin families have a small increased risk of other rare cancers, so it is important that the family is aware of this, as any unu­ sual symptoms in the future need to be taken seriously with earlier detection of cancers [235].
