Methods: The specimen for the study was sent by the dermatology department for histopathology after skin biopsy. Results: Out of 42 patients, 15 patients studied were males and the rest of the cases were females. The male to female ratio was 0.55:1. Maximum (15 cases) cases were in the age group of 50–59 years. Apart from sunlight, chronic arsenic exposure is an important risk factor of BCC. Basal cell hyperplasia and squamous cell carcinoma are the histological differential diagnosis of nodular BCC and basosquamous BCC. Conclusion: BCC is a disease of the older age group and with female preponderance in our study. Nodular basal cell carcinoma was the most common histologic type of basal cell carcinoma. The face was the most common site for BCC followed by the scalp. UV radiations and Arsenic do play role in the pathogenesis of BCC. CD10 helps differentiate superficial BCC from basal cell hyperplasia.

E‑mail: drchetanjain162@gmail.com INTRODUCTION Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common malignant tumor of human beings. This occurs in the sun‑exposed areas of the skin leading to its damage. BCC is a slow‑growing tumor with very few cases of metastasis. Rarely, it could be destructive locally, if diagnosis and treatment are delayed. Clinically, morphology of lesion varies from pink colored to pearly papules with ulceration or telangiectatic vessels. The most common site of BCC is the head and neck region but can also involve trunk and extremities.[1,2] Figure 1 show BCC present on trunk. In the literature, more than 26 types of BCC are described but common clinicopathological subtypes are nodular, ulcerative, superficial, morpheaform, infiltrative, and fibroepithelial. Morphologically, single or multiple subtypes could be present in a single case. Lesions could vary from highly pigmented (dark in color) to slightly dark in color. BCC is currently treated through electrodesiccation and curettage, cryosurgery, and Mohs micrographic surgery. MATERIAL AND METHODS The present study was conducted on 42 BCC cases, consisting of ‑ patients attending the Dermatology OPD, suspected cases were submitted for histopathological examination in the Department of Pathology, Medical College, Kolkata. Histopathological diagnosis was established on routine hematoxylin and eosin staining of the section, the study period was between January 2013 to June 2014. This study aimed to identify the spectrum of histology of BCC along with clinicopathological correlation. Inclusion criteria consisted of histologically confirmed cases of BCC and exclusion criteria consisted of cases that do not How to cite this article: Jain C, Garg N, Singh S, Chattopadhyay S.

Jain, et al.: Basal cell carcinoma‑ A study of Eastern India I n d i a n J o u r n a l o f P a t h o l o g y a n d M i c r o b i o l o g y ¦ V o l u m e 6 5 ¦ I s s u e 4 ¦ O c t o b e r - D e c e m b e r 2 0 2 2 871 a family history of BCC and had early onset of BCC at an age of 30 years. The oldest patient in this study was a 78‑year‑old male. One patient had xeroderma pigmentosum and he was the second youngest case in the study (31 years). The mean and median age of patients in this study was 54.23 ± 11.74 years and 52.5 years, respectively. Out of the 42 cases, 29 cases had nodular BCC and only 1 case each of basosquamous and sclerosing BCC. Hence, the most common type of histology encountered was nodular type whereas sclerosing and basosquamous were the least common. Figures 2 and 3 illustrate the clinical appearance of Nodular BCC and Figure 4 depicts its histological picture. After nodular, the most common histology of BCC was adenoid (five cases) followed by two cases of superficial BCC. Figure 5 shows adenoid BCC in which tumor cells show glandular differentiation. The most common site was the face (21 cases, 50%), followed by the scalp (17 cases, 40.48%). If we combine cases of scalp and face regions to make it under a single category under the head region, then the total number of cases amounts to 38 (90.47%). Therefore, the most common site was the head region. Only one case (2.38%) was reported to be from the upper limb and three (7.14%) cases from the trunk. The study showed a correlation between the presence and absence of sunlight exposure in BCC cases. Patients working outdoors had plentiful exposure to sunlight. Cases working indoors had comparatively less amount of exposure to sunlight. Out of 42 cases, 23 (54.77%) had a history of direct sunlight exposure for a long duration and 19 (45.23%) cases were found, spending most of their time indoors. Table 1 demonstrates that out of 42 BCC cases 18 (42.85%) had a history of exposure to arsenic and 24 (57.15%) cases did not have exposure history. A single case of morphea had a history of arsenic exposure. Twelve out of 29 cases of nodular BCC had an exposure history. Arsenic exposure through contaminated water is quite prevalent in eastern India, therefore, determining its history is very important. Arsenic plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of BCC. In one case of basal cell hyperplasia, the expression of CD 10 was reported as negative while the expression of CD 10 was present in superficial BCC. Figure 6 shows clinical and Figure 7 show histology of superficial BCC. Similarly, baso-squamous BCC as shown in figure 8 could be a diagnostic challenge considering basoloid squmous cell carcinoma as differential. DISCUSSION BCC is a cancer of hair‑bearing skin areas, especially in the head and neck region. In some pockets of eastern India and Bangladesh region, the amount of arsenic present in water exceeds the safe level.[3] Chronic arsenic exposure is considered a risk factor of BCC. Thus, amount of BCC cases in this arsenic belt will be more as compared to other areas of the Indian subcontinent. Therefore, we took proper history for the presence of the excessive amount of arsenic in water at these places.

Jain, et al.: Basal cell carcinoma‑ A study of Eastern India I n d i a n J o u r n a l o f P a t h o l o g y a n d M i c r o b i o l o g y ¦ V o l u m e 6 5 ¦ I s s u e 4 ¦ O c t o b e r - D e c e m b e r 2 0 2 2 872 out of 42 patients, 18 (42.85%) patients were from this arsenic belt area. Cheng et al.[4] also reported thatthe BCC risk increases by 3‑4 times when drinking water is contaminated by arsenic. Therefore, we should always take a proper history of arsenic contamination in water. Clearly, more outdoor work means more exposure to UV radiations and more chances of BCC[5] In the present study, patients working outdoors were considered as subjects for chronic UV exposure, for example, farmers, building workers, fishermen, or roadside hawkers, etc., In our study, 23 (54.77%) cases out of 42 worked outdoors. The differential diagnosis for superficial BCC is basal cell hyperplasia and basosquamous BCC for squamous cell carcinoma, for which CD 10 could be used for differentiation. It was noted that the expression is present in superficial BCC and absent in basal cell hyperplasia. CD 10 expression could also be used to differentiate between trichoepithelioma and BCC. In BCC, focal positivity was seen in tumor cells whereas stromal positivity was present in trichoepithelioma.[6] Similarly, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) could be confused with basosquamous BCC. In basosquamous BCC dual population of cells are present, cells with scanty cytoplasm and cells with a relatively moderate amount of cytoplasm but in SCC cells with a similar (moderate) amount of cytoplasm are present. CONCLUSION BCC is a disease of the older age group. It affects both males and females with female preponderance in our study population. Nodular BCC was the most common histologic type. The face was the most common site for BCC followed by the scalp. Sunlight exposure and arsenic are important risk factors for BCC, especially in eastern India. CD 10 could be used to differentiate with basal cell hyperplasia. Declaration of patient consent The authors certify that they have obtained all appropriate patient consent forms.

MALIGNANT MELANOMA IS a virulent form of skin cancer that, if it spreads to the lymph or the other organs of the body, can bring about death within ﬁ ve years of diagnosis. In recent years, more cases of melanoma have emerged and this is thought to be due largely to people’s increased exposure to ultraviolet light, which is the main trigger for melanoma, as well as their greater awareness of the incidence and risks of skin cancer. Melanoma initially appears as small freckles or mole-like marks, usually on the skin but also in the eye, that gradually grow and change shape: clinical diagnosis is usually via visual inspection and characterisation of the freckle or mole according to what are known as the ABCD parameters: Asymmetry, Border, Colour and Diameter. E is sometimes also used: the Evolution of the lesion in terms of changes in shape and size and the feel of the surrounding skin. Diagnosing melanoma is uncertain, but the lesions tend to be asymmetric, to change in size and nature and to display irregular borders and uneven colour. “Experts may also examine a skin lesion under high magniﬁ cation using a dermoscope, a handheld magnifying device that uses polarised light; and consider further features for classiﬁ cation, especially those involving texture and textural patterns,” explains Dr Stella Atkins, Professor of Computing Science at Simon Fraser University, near Vancouver. Atkins has undertaken many years of research into support for medical science through the application of computing techniques: “All of my work is directed to improving patient care and outcomes using computers, across a wide spectrum – ranging from telepathology systems in Central Asia for improving pathology diagnoses to designing algorithms which enhance low dose computerised tomography images, allowing safer patient scans,” she reﬂ ects. Atkins is currently leading a project that is seeking to develop a tool to remove uncertainty from the diagnostic process for melanoma. In addition to improving accuracy of diagnosis, the tool should speed up patient referral for expert attention if malignant melanoma is suspected or diagnosed. Funded by the Canadian Government’s Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council, within their Collaborative Health Research Projects Programme, the project started in 2008 and expects to deliver its results by 2013. IMPROVING DIAGNOSIS OF MELANOMA The project scope includes both melanocytic (moles) and non-melanocytic lesions, both of which can be cancerous. Variations and, indeed, similarities between types of skin lesions mean that any attempt to classify them automatically requires comprehensive and clear information about their characteristics as well as the ability to determine the likelihood of their nature by reference to impeccable sources. The project therefore employs machine learning, a variation of artiﬁ cial intelligence, which is designed to derive determinations from complex empirical inputs by reference to ‘experience’ of examples of the types of inputs, the characteristics of which are amassed into a body of knowledge. In the case of Atkins’ project, the input data is a previously ‘unseen’ image of a lesion, and the machine learning algorithm will classify the image according to the previously amassed body of knowledge. Pixel perfect diagnosis of melanoma A project underway at Simon Fraser University in Canada is developing innovative technology to improve diagnosis of melanoma by adapting dermoscopy and photography methods and using artiﬁ cial intelligence to create handheld devices capable of inspection and rapid analysis of suspect skin lesions 80 INTERNATIONAL INNOVATION FIGURE 1.

The rules that the project team are applying are expressed via algorithms based on quantitative data obtained from computer ‘training data’ about lesion colours, dimensions and textures: “For the training set we developed a tablet PC-based programme for dermatologists to draw the borders around lesions in skin images. We used the dermatologists’ outlines on 120 images as our gold standard when validating our methods,” explains Atkins, who goes on to point out the painstaking nature of compiling basic gold standard data for computer training: “We initially focused on measuring the dermoscopic structure ‘pigment network’ (PN) – which is important for diagnosis, and obtained 94 per cent accuracy in identifying lesions with PN Present”. With the project well underway, the team are now detailing the dermoscopic structures called ‘streaks’ and ‘pseudopods’ of the dark, radially-orientated lines that can be found in melanoma. SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING Once the base training data has been acquired, the computer will separate the lesion area from the new input image by mapping the lesion, pixel by pixel, in line with the labels recorded by the dermatologists. During this process, the computer will ascertain whether, according to probability, the part of the image in question is skin or lesion, and if lesion, what can be implied from its position relative to the other lesion pixels – inferring a relationship between the elements of the image of the lesion and determining the probability of its conformance to the criteria for lesion (rather than skin). The machine learning approach that the project is taking is ‘supervised’, ie. it has a gold standard training set, thereby maximising the quality of the computer’s algorithmic determinations. Supervised machine learning methods are also used to identify lesions having speciﬁ c texture characteristics such as PNs and streaks, through identiﬁ cation of relevant features associated with these textures. The project hardware platform comprises a variety of PC processors, Apple and other smartphones, hand- held dermoscopy devices and cameras. So far, the project has found that images of lesions taken in uncorrected mode provide better inputs for machine learning, and that other picture formats require additional support: “We are continuing to develop new correction methods based on basic camera parameters observed from imaging standard colour charts,” afﬁ rms Atkins. A MULTIDISCIPLINARY PROJECT The project is truly multidisciplinary, bringing together world-class skills in computing, cancer care and dermatology. Among its key participants are Drs Harvey Lui and David McLean from the Vancouver Skin Care Centre, and Dr Tim Lee from the British Columbia Cancer Agency. Practical considerations arising from the different perspectives require balance and compromises to be achieved, as Atkins sums up: “We computer scientists want super high-quality skin images obtained using oil on the skin to prevent white scale from appearing in the images. However, the dermatologists point out that in a clinical setting, using oil is very messy; it takes much longer to deal with each patient”. Adjustments that have been made to accommodate such requirements include adapting the computer algorithms to take white scale in images into account and using gel or alcohol as a means to obtaining better deﬁ ned images of lesions. PROJECT OUTCOMES The overall objective for Atkins’ group is to develop a low-cost point-of-care device for healthcare professionals, and it is intended to release a prototype smartphone version at the World Congress of Dermatology in Vancouver in 2015. The project has already attracted signiﬁ cant interest from the dermatology world, with interim deliverables winning a number of awards, and has also given rise to a number of published papers on the techniques involved. In the future Atkins intends to release the compendium of images and diagnostic information that the project is compiling, as a

a number of published papers on the techniques involved. In the future Atkins intends to release the compendium of images and diagnostic information that the project is compiling, as a teaching and education aid for others: “We are creating a new atlas of over 300 dermoscopy images, in conjunction with Raman spectroscopy data and near infrared images, together with the pathology diagnosis. We already have over 170 dermoscopy and near infrared images, of which over 80 also have Raman spectroscopy data,” she elaborates. Encouragingly, the progress made through this innovative marriage of computer science and dermoscopy looks set to continue.
